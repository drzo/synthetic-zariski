The goal of this note is to show that $\Pic(\bP^n) = \Z$ in the setting of Synthetic Algebraic
Geometry \cite{SAG}.
We will also present Matthias' strengthened version of this statement, which states that the
map $\Z\times BGL_1\rightarrow BGL_1^{\bP^1},~p,l\mapsto (x\mapsto l\times O(p)(x))$
is an equivalence.

One application is that $\Aut(\bP^n)$ is $PGL_{n+1}$.

We follow the proof of Horrock's Lemma as presented in Lam's book on Serre's problem \cite{Lam}
on projective modules (this is not the argument presented in Lombardi-Quitt\'e \cite{LQ})
in the case $n=1$. For the general case, we don't follow the Quillen patching technique
presented in the 1976 paper \cite{Quillen}, but instead use the strengthened version.
We then explain how we can deduce $\Aut(\bP^n)$ is $PGL_{n+1}$.
