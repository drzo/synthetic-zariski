The goal of this note is to show that $\Pic(\bP^n) = \Z$ in the setting of Synthetic Algebraic
Geometry \cite{draft}. We actually present a strengthening of this result,
which in particular states the equivalence
$$\KR^{\bP^1}\simeq \Z\times \KR$$
%We will also present Matthias' strengthened version of this statement, which states that the
%map $\Z\times \KR\rightarrow {\KR}^{\bP^1},~p,l\mapsto (x\mapsto l\times O(p)(x))$
%is an equivalence.

One application is that $\Aut(\bP^n)$ is $PGL_{n+1}$.

For the case $n=1$,
we follow the proof of Horrock's Lemma as presented in Lam's book on Serre's problem \cite{Lam}
on projective modules\footnote{This argument is different from the one presented in Lombardi-Quitt\'e \cite{lombardi-quitte}; we instead give a constructive version of the proof of Nashier-Nichols \cite{Nashier}.}.
For the general case, we don't follow the Quillen patching technique
presented in the 1976 paper \cite{Quillen}, but instead present an argument which uses
our description of ${\KR}^{\bP^1}$.
We then explain how we can deduce that $\Aut(\bP^n)$ is $PGL_{n+1}$.

 One point of this work is to show that all these results can be proven axiomatically in the
 setting of univalent type theory with the 3 axioms described in \cite{draft}.
