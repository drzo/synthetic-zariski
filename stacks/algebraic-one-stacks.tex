\begin{definition}
  A 1-type $X$ is a \notion{algebraic stack},
  if $x=_Xy$ is an algebraic space for all $x,y:X$ and
  and there merely is a scheme $U$ with a formally smooth surjection $u$ onto $X$.
  If, in addition, there is a
  formally étale surjection $u:U\to X$,
  $X$ is called a \notion{Deligne-Mumford stack}.
\end{definition}

\begin{proposition}
  Let $G$ be an étale group scheme acting on a scheme $X$,
  then the homotopy quotient $X//G$ is a Deligne-Mumford stack.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
  The fibers of $X\to X//G$ are merely equivalent to $G$
  and therefore étale.
  This means the map $X\to X//G$ is formally étale.
  Let the action of $G$ be given by a dependent type
  $\rho:BG\to \Sch$.
  The identity types in $X//G$ are of the form:
  \begin{align*}
    &(x,p)=(x',p') \\
    \simeq& \sum_{g:x=_{BG}x'}\mathrm{transport}_{\rho}(g)(p)=_Xp'
  \end{align*}
  So as a dependent sum of schemes over a scheme,
  the identity types are always scheme. 
\end{proof}
