\subsection{Definition and basic properties}

Usually, in some of the definitions below,
there is the additional condition that types are sheaves for the fppf topology.
We will just ignore this condition for now.

\begin{definition}
  A set $X$ is an \notion{algebraic space},
  if $x=_Xy$ is a scheme for all $x,y:X$ and
  there merely is a scheme $U$ with a formally étale surjection onto $X$.
\end{definition}

So any scheme is an algebraic space.

\begin{lemma}
Let $X$ be an algebraic space. Any function from $X$ to $\N$ is merely is bounded.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
This holds for scheme so given a surjective map $U\to X$ with $U$ a scheme, this holds for $X$.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
Algebraic spaces have étale-local choice.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Immediate from the definition using the fact that Zariski-local choice implies étale-local choice.
\end{proof}

\subsection{Fundamental theorem of algebraic spaces}

In brief, algebraic spaces are quotient of of schemes by étale equivalence relations.

\begin{lemma}
Assume given a set $X$ then the maps:
\[ \sum_{R:X\to X\to \Prop} R\ \mathrm{equivalence\ relation} \to \sum_{Y:\mathrm{Set}} \sum_{p:X\to Y} p\ \mathrm{surjective}\]
\[R \mapsto (X/R,[\_])\]
are inverse to each other.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
TODO, basic HoTT
\end{proof}


\subsection{Morphisms of algebraic spaces}

\begin{lemma}
  Let $X,Y$ be algebraic spaces and $f:X\to Y$ a map.
  Then there merely are schemes $U,V$ together with formally étale surjections
  $u:U\to X$, $v:V\to Y$ and $\widetilde{f}:U\to V$ such that
  \begin{center}
    \begin{tikzcd}
      U\ar[r,"\widetilde{f}"]\ar[d,"u"] & V\ar[d,"v"] \\
      X\ar[r,"f"] & Y
    \end{tikzcd}
  \end{center}
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
  We merely have a formally étale surjections $v:V\to Y$ and $u:U\to X$ by assumption.
  Let $P'$ be the iterated pullback:
  \begin{center}
    \begin{tikzcd}
      P'\ar[r]\ar[d,"p'"] & P\ar[r]\ar[d,"p"] & V\ar[d,"v"] \\
      U\ar[r,"u"] & X\ar[r,"f"] & Y
    \end{tikzcd}
  \end{center}
  Then $P=(x:X)\times W_x$, with $W_x\colonequiv (z:V)\times f(x)=v(z)$.
  As a dependent sum of schemes, $W_x$ is a scheme.
  For the same reason, $P'=(x:U)\times W_{u(x)}$ is a scheme.
  As itereted pullback of a formally étale surjection,
  $p'$ is a formally étale surjection and
  therefore also the composition with $u$.
\end{proof}

Such a map $\widetilde{f}$ is called a scheme-replacement for $f$.

\begin{definition}
A property of morphisms is called étale-local if it is stable by pre and post composition with étale surjective maps.
\end{definition}

This will be useful because of the following lemma:

\begin{lemma}
Assume given a morphism $f$ between algebraic spaces, and an étale-local property $P$ of morphisms. The following are equivalent:
\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
\item The map $f$ has property $P$. 
\item Some scheme replacement $\widetilde{f}$ has property $P$. 
\item All scheme replacements $\widetilde{f}$ have property $P$. 
\end{enumerate}
\end{lemma}

\begin{lemma}
The following classes of morphisms are étale-local:
\begin{itemize}
\item Formally étale maps.
\item Surjective maps.
\item $\cdots$
\end{itemize}
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
TODO
\end{proof}
