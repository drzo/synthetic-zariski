\begin{theorem}[Tychonov]
Assume given $I$ an overtly discrete type and $C_i$ compact Hausdorff spaces depending on $i:I$. Then:
\[\prod_{i:I}C_i\]
is compact Hausdorff.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
We can assume $I = \mathrm{colim}_{k:\N} F_k$ with $F_k$ a finite type. Then:
\[\prod_{i:I}C_i = \prod_{i:\mathrm{colim}_{k:\N} F_k} C_i\]
\[= \lim_{k:\N} C_i^{F_k}\]
and we can conclude using that compact Hausdorff spaces are stable under sequential limits and finite products.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}\label{closed-to-open-is-open}
If $P,U$ are propositions with $P$ closed and $U$ open, then:
\[P\to U\]
implies:
\[\neg P \lor U\]
In particular $P\to U$ is open.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
We have that $\neg P\lor U$ is open and therefore $\neg\neg$-stable, from which we can conclude by intuitionistic logic.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}\label{tychonov-dual-proposition}
Assume $C$ closed and $U_p$ an open proposition depending on $p:P$. Then:
\[\prod_{p:P}U_p\]
is open.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
By \cref{closed-to-open-is-open} it is enough to show that there merely exists $V$ open such that:
\[\forall (p:P). U_p = V\]
But since $P$ is a proposition we have that $\forall(p:P). U_p$ satisfies this, and it is open by \cref{compact-hausdorff-compact}.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}\label{tychonov-dual-auxiliary}
Assume $p:C\to D$ a surjective map with $C$ and $D$ compact Hausdorff. Given $E_x$ overtly discrete depending on $x:D$, if:
\[\prod_{x:C}E_{p(x)}\]
is overtly discrete then so is:
\[\prod_{x:D}E(x)\]
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Since the map is surjective we have an embedding:
\[\prod_{x:D}E(x)\subset \prod_{x:C}E_{p(x)}\]
But the fiber over $g:\prod_{x:C}E_{p(x)}$ is:
\[\forall (x,y:C). p(x)=p(y) \to g(x)=g(y)\]
which is open by \cref{tychonov-dual-proposition} and \cref{compact-hausdorff-compact}.
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}[Tychonov's dual]\label{tychonov-dual}
Assume given $C$ compact Hausdorff and $I_x$ overtly discrete depending on $x:C$. Then:
\[\prod_{x:C}I(x)\]
is overtly discrete.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
By local choice and \cref{tychonov-dual-auxiliary} we can assume that $C$ is Stone and that we have towers of finite types $(\mathrm{Fin}(l_{k,x}))_{k:\N}$ depending on $x:C$. We write $C=S$. Then using \cref{scott-continuity-right} and the fact that overtly discrete types are stable under sequential colimits, it is enough to prove that for $S$ Stone and $l_x:\N$ depending on $x:S$ we have that:
\[\prod_{x:S}\mathrm{Fin}(l_{x})\]
is overtly discrete. 

Using boundedness, the fact that:
\[S_k = \Sigma(x:S). l_x = k\] 
is Stone and that overtly discrete types are stable under finite products, we just have to prove that for any $l:\N$ and $S$ Stone we have that:
\[S\to \mathrm{Fin}(l)\]
is overtly discrete. We can conclude using that \cref{factorisation-compact-hausdorff-finite} and that Stone are limits of finite types.
\end{proof}
