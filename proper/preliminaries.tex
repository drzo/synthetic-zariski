We will use \cite{draft}[Lemma 4.2.11]:

\begin{lemma}
  \label{closed-implies-open-to-or}
  Let $C$ be a closed proposition and $U$ be an open proposition,
  then $C\to U$ is equivalent to $\neg C \vee U$.
\end{lemma}

We will also need:

\begin{lemma}
  \label{commute-open-in-closed-prop}
  Let $C$ be a closed proposition and $U : C \to \Open$ a family of open propositions.
  Then there merely is an open proposition $\tilde{U} : \Prop$ such that for 
  any $c : C$, $U(c) = \tilde{U}$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
  By \cite[Theorem 4.2.6]{draft}, $U$ can be represented by a list $f_1,\ldots,f_n$
  of elements of $R^C$. Since $C$ is a closed proposition, the map $R \to R^C$ 
  is a quotient map, hence surjective. So we can merely find preimages
  $\tilde{f_1},\ldots,\tilde{f_n} : R$.
  Then we take $\tilde U$ to be $D(\tilde f_1,\ldots,\tilde f_n)$.
\end{proof}
