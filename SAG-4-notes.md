Topics to discuss
-----------------

If there is a specific topic you would really like to discuss or learn more about, please add it here.

Open problems in SAG
--------------------

We can use the list [here](https://github.com/felixwellen/synthetic-zariski?tab=readme-ov-file#questions).

Open problems in AG
-------------------
We can try to figure out how to formulate open problems of classical algebraic geometry synthetically.
We can also discuss how much is gained by reasoning synthetically in each case. 

+ Jacobian conjecture ([wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacobian_conjecture)):
  This is formulated for a field of characteristic zero.
  We do not know if it is to assume characteristic zero and naively translate the conjecture.
  It seems to work in the dimension=1 case with what we know from .
  
Renamings
---------
There is the idea to discuss a couple of possible renamings.

| Current name               | Alternatives                                   | 
|----------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| SQC axion                  | Duality axiom, Regularity axiom                |
| formally étale replacement | Crytalline modality, Coreduction, deRham stack |
| o-étale                    | o-cover (o-étale is already used a lot)        |
