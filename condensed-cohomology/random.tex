Compilation of various facts on synthetic stone duality which I (Hugo) don't know where to put. I'm not even sure where I should put this section.

\subsection{Overt stone spaces}

\begin{proposition}
Let $S$ be a stone space. TFAE:
\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
\item $S$ is overt, i.e. for all $U:X\to \mathrm{Open}$ we have that $\exists_{x:S} U(x)$ is an open proposition.
\item For all $C:X\to \mathrm{Closed}$ we have that $\forall_{x:S} C(x)$ is closed.
\item Equality in $2^S$ is decidable.
\end{enumerate}
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
We prove (i) implies (ii) implies (iii) implies (i).
\begin{itemize}
\item (i) implies (ii). Given $C:X\to \mathrm{Closed}$ we have that:
\[\forall_{x:S} C(x) = \neg \exists_{x:S} \neg C(x)\]
as $C(x)$ is $\neg\neg$-stable, and we can conclude using overtness.
\item (ii) implies (iii). We have that (ii) implies equality in $2^S$ closed, but it is always open so we can conclude.
\item (iii) implies (i). Given $U:X\to \mathrm{Open}$ we have that $U = \exists_{n:\N} U_n$ with $U_n$ decidable. We have that:
\[\neg \exists_{x:S} U_n(x) = \forall_{x:S} \neg U_n(x)\]
which is decidable by (iii). Therefore by Markov (TODO is this correct Markov?):
\[\neg(\forall_{n:\N} \neg (\exists_{x:S} U_n(x))) =  \exists_{n:\N} \neg\neg (\exists_{x:S} U_n(x)) =  \exists_{n:\N} \exists_{x:S} U_n(x) = \exists_{x:S}U(x)\]
So we have that $\exists_{x:S}U(x)$ is indeed open.
\end{itemize}
\end{proof}


\subsection{Overtly discrete boolean algebra}

\begin{remark}
Open in $\mathbb{N}$ are countable in the sense that they merely are decidable in $\N$.
\end{remark}

\begin{proposition}
A boolean algebra is countably presented if and only if its underlying type is overtly discrete.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
TODO
\end{proof}
