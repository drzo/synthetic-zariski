\subsection{Definitions}
\begin{definition}
  For $B$ a countably presented Boolean algebra, we define $Sp(B)$ as the set of Boolean morphisms from $B$ to $2$. 
\end{definition}
\begin{definition}
  We define the predicate on types $\isSt$ by 
  \begin{equation}
    \isSt(X) := \sum\limits_{B : Boole} X = Sp(B)
  \end{equation} 
  A type $X$ is called \textit{Stone} if $\isSt(X)$ is inhabited.
\end{definition}
\subsection{Examples of Stone types}
\begin{example}\label{ExampleBAunderEmpty}
  The dual to the trivial Boolean algebra from \Cref{ExampleBAunderEmpty} is the empty set 
  $\emptyset$, 
  as $0\neq 1$ in $2$, but $0=1$ in the trivial Boolean algebra, 
  there can be no functions preserving both $0$ and $1$ 
  from the trivial Boolean algebra to $2$. 
\end{example}
\begin{example}
  The dual to $C$ from \Cref{ExampleBAunderCantor} is called Cantor space 
  and denoted $2^\N$. 
  By \Cref{rmkMorphismsOutOfQuotient}, terms of $2^\N$ 
  correspond to set-theoretic functions $\N \to 2$. 
  We also call such functions binary sequences. 
\end{example}
\begin{example}
  The dual to $\N_{(co)fin}$ from \Cref{ExampleBAunderNinfty} is called 
  $\N_\infty$. By \Cref{rmkMorphismsOutOfQuotient}, terms of $\N_\infty$ 
  correspond to functions $\alpha: \N \to 2$ such that $\alpha(n) \wedge \alpha(m) = 0$ 
  whenever $n \neq m$. This means that $\alpha(n) = 1$ for at most one $n\in\N$. 
  There is an embedding $\N \to \N_\infty$ sending $n$ to the unique sequence $\chi_n$
  which sends $n$ to $1$. 
  There is furthermore a term $\infty:\N_\infty$ which is the sequence which is constantly $0$. 
\end{example}
