\rednote{TODO, is $\Boole$ closed under countable limits? 
  It has finite colimits, as it has pushouts and initial object.
  It should also have sequential colimits (TODO). 
  Is a countable coproduct the sequential colimit of it's initial finite coproducts?

\begin{lemma}\label{BoolePushouts}
  Countably presented Boolean algebras are closed under pushout. 
\end{lemma} 
\begin{proof}
  Let $A,B,C:\Boole$, and suppose $f:A\to B, g:A \to C$ are Boolean morphisms. 
  Let $G_A, G_B,G_C$ be the underlying countable sets of generators for $B,C$ and 
  let $R_A,R_B,R_C$ be the underlying countable sets of relations. 
  Consider $P$ the Boolean algebra generated by $G_B\sqcup G_C$ under the relations 
  $R_B\cup R_C \cup F$ where $F$ is the set of expressions $f(a)-g(a), a\in G_A$.
  
  Note that as the generators of $B$ are included in those of $P$, 
  and all relations of $B$ are included in those of $P$, there is a map $h:B\to P$. 
  Similarly there is a map $i:C\to P$. 
  We now claim that the following is a pushout square:
  \begin{equation}\begin{tikzcd}
    A \arrow[r,"f"] \arrow[d,"g"] & B \arrow[d,"h"]\\
    C \arrow[r,"i"] & P
  \end{tikzcd}\end{equation}  
  Suppose $\beta:B \to X, \gamma:C\to X$ are such that $\beta\circ f = \gamma \circ h$. 
  $\beta,\gamma$ then induce maps on the generators of $P$. 
  These maps respect $F$ as $\beta\circ f=\gamma\circ h$, and they must respect $R_B,R_C$ as they are maps out of $B,C$. 
  Therefore, $\beta,\gamma$ induce a map $e:P\to X$, such that 
  $e(b) = \beta(b)$ for $b:G_B$ and $e(c)=\gamma(c)$ for $c:G_C$. 
  Furthermore, any map $P\to X$ with this property must agree with $e$ on all the generators of $P$, 
  and therefore equal $e$. Thus $e$ is the unique extension $P\to X$. 
  Thus $P$ the above square is indeed a pushout. 
\end{proof}
%\begin{lemma}\label{BooleCoEqualizers}
%  Countably presented Boolean algebras are closed under coequalizers.
%\end{lemma}
%\begin{proof}
%  Let $f,g:A\to B$ be Boolean morphisms.
%  Define $C = B/R$, where $R$ is given by the relations $fa-ga,~a\in G_A$, for $G_A$ the set of generators of $A$.
%  Suppose that we have a map $x:B\to D$ with $xf = gf$. Then $x$ respects $R$, and thus defines a map $y:C \to D$. 
%  Furthermore, any map $C\to D$ extending $x$ agrees with $y$ on the generators of $C$, 
%  and is thus equal to $y$. Therefore $C$ is the coequalizer of $f,g$. 
%\end{proof}

%%\begin{corollary}\label{CoCompletenessBoole}
%%  The category of countably presented Boolean algebras contains all finite colimits. 
%%\end{corollary}
%%\begin{proof}
%%  Recall that $\Boole$ has an initial object given by $2$. 
%%  By \Cref{BoolePushouts}, 
%%%  it is therefore closed under coproducts. 
%%%  By \Cref{BooleCoEqualizers}, 
%%  it follows that $\Boole$ contains all finite colimits.
