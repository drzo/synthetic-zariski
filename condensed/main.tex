%In synthetic algebraic geometry (SAG) \cite{draft}, we study finitely presented algebras over a commutative ring. 
%In this work, we study countably presented Boolean algebras instead. 
%Where the finitely presented algebras over a commutative ring induce a Zariski topos, 
%%the opposite category of these 
%the countably presented Boolean algebras induce the topos of light condensed sets \cite{Scholze}. 
%\cite{draft} proposes an axiomatization of the Zariski topos in univalent homotopy type theory \cite{hott}. 
%In this work, we propose similar axioms, which we expect to be modelled by light condensed sets. 
%% Furthermore, spectra of countably presented Boolean algebras correspond to quotients of Cantor space

\section{Countably presented Boolean algebras}
\subsection{Definitions}
\begin{definition}
  The language of Boolean algebras consists of
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Two symbols for constants $0,1$. 
    \item Two binary function symbols $\wedge, \vee$.
    \item One unary function symbol $\neg$. 
  \end{itemize}
\end{definition}
\begin{definition}
  The algebraic theory of Boolean algebras is as follows:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item We have axioms regarding order, sometimes called identity and absorption:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item $0 \wedge a = 0$. 
      \item $1 \wedge a = a$. 
      \item $0 \vee a = a$. 
      \item $1 \vee a = 1$. 
      \item $a \vee (a \wedge b) = a$
      \item $a \wedge (a \vee b) = a$. 
    \end{itemize}
    \item We have axioms regarding negations:
      \begin{itemize}
        \item $a \vee \neg a = 1$. 
        \item $a \wedge \neg a = 0$. 
        \item $\neg 1 = 0$. 
        \item $\neg \neg a = a$. 
      \end{itemize}
    \item We have axioms regarding commutativity and associativity:
      \begin{itemize}
        \item $a \vee b = b \vee a$. 
        \item $a \wedge b = b \wedge a$. 
        \item $(a \vee b) \vee c = a \vee (b \vee c)$. 
        \item $(a \wedge b) \wedge c = a \wedge (b \wedge c)$. 
      \end{itemize}
    \item We have axioms regarding distributivity:
      \begin{itemize}
        \item $a \vee (b \wedge c) = ( a \vee b) \wedge (a \vee c)$. 
        \item $a \wedge (b \vee c) = (a \wedge b) \vee ( a\wedge c)$. 
      \end{itemize}
    \item We have axioms called deMorgan's laws:
      \begin{itemize}
        \item $\neg (a \vee b ) = (\neg a) \wedge (\neg b)$. 
        \item $\neg (a \wedge b) = (\neg a) \vee (\neg b)$. 
      \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
\end{definition}
\begin{definition}
  Some language we will use is as follows:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item A Boolean algebra is a set-theoretic model of the theory of Boolean algebras. 
      It consists of a set $B$ and terms $0_B,1_B: B, \neg_B : B \to B, \vee_B, \wedge_B : B \times B \to B$ 
      satisfying the theory of Boolean algebras. 
      Sometimes we will leave out the subscript $(\cdot)_B$. 
    \item A morphism of Boolean algebra is a function between such sets preserving the operations above. 
      If $A,B$ are Boolean algebras, we write $A \to B$ for the type of such morphisms. 
%    \item We denote $id_B$ for the identity morphism $B \to B$. 
    \item If we have have two morphisms $f:A\to B , g : B \to A$ such that 
      $f\circ g (b) = b, g \circ f (a) = a$ for all $a:A, b:B$, 
      we say $A$ and $B$ are isomorphic and write $A \simeq B$. 
  \end{itemize}
\end{definition}
\begin{remark}
  We sometimes write $a \leq b$ and  $b \geq a$. Both of these mean that 
  $a\wedge b = a$, or equivalently $ a\vee b = b$. 
  Interpreting this notation as an order relation, we often think in the following terms:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item $a\wedge b$ is the biggest element $c$ with $c \leq a$ and $c\leq b$.
    \item $a\vee b$ is the smallest element $c$ with $c \geq a$ and $c \geq b$. 
    \item $0$ is the smallest element. 
    \item $1$ is the biggest element. 
  \end{itemize}
\end{remark}
\begin{remark}
  For a family of expressions $x_i$ over a 
  finite set of indices $I = \{i_0, \cdots, i_n\}$, we will sometimes denote 
  \begin{itemize}
    \item $\bigvee_{i:I} x_i = x_{i_0} \vee \cdots \vee x_{i_n}$,
      with the understanding that this equals $0$ if $I$ is empty. 
    \item $\bigwedge_{i:I} x_i = x_{i_0} \wedge \cdots \wedge x_{i_n}$,
      with the understanding that this equals $1$ if $I$ is empty. 
  \end{itemize}
\end{remark}

\begin{definition}
  Let $\mathcal L$ be a language, 
  let $\phi,\psi$ be terms in any language,
  and suppose that for some index set $I$ we have 
  for each $i:I$ two terms $a_i,b_i$ of same sort in $\mathcal L$. 
  Let $E= (a_i = b_i)_{i:I}$. 

  We say that $E$ allows us to rewrite $\phi$ to $\psi$ if there is a finite list of expressions 
  $\phi = \phi_0 , \phi_1, \phi_2, \cdots, \phi_{n-1}, \phi_n = \psi$, 
  such that each $\phi_{n+1}$ is given by taking $\phi_n$ and either changing one occurence of $a_i$ to  $b_i$, 
  or one occurence of $b_i$ to $a_i$ for some $i:I$. 
\end{definition}


\begin{definition}
  Given any set of symbols $G$, the free Boolean algebra on $G$, denoted $\langle G \rangle$
  is constructed as follows:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item We add $G$ as set of constants to the language of Boolean algebras. 
    \item We consider the set of terms in this language. 
    \item If there merely exists some finite sequence of 
      equalities from the theory of Boolean algebras allowing us to rewrite one term to another, 
      we consider the two terms to be equivalent. 
    \item The free Boolean algebra is then the set of equivalence classes under this relation. 
  \end{itemize}
\end{definition}
\begin{definition}
  Let $G$ be a set of symbols. Consider $\Phi$ the set of terms in the language 
  given by adding $G$ as constants to the language of Boolean algebras. 
  Let $R \subseteq \Phi$. 
  we construct the quotient $\langle G \rangle / R$ as follows:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item We start with $\Phi$. 
    \item If there merely exists some finite sequence of 
      equalities from the theory of Boolean algebras or the set of equalities $\{r = 0 | r \in R\}$ 
      allowing us to rewrite one term to another, we consider the two terms to be equivalent. 
    \item The $\langle G \rangle / R$ is then the set of equivalence classes under this relation. 
  \end{itemize}
\end{definition}
\begin{remark}
  For $G,R$ as above, $\langle G \rangle / R$ is a Boolean algebra. 
\end{remark}
\begin{remark}\label{rmkMorphismsOutOfQuotient}
  Let $B$ be a Boolean algebra, and let $G,R$ be as above. 
  To define a morphism $\langle G \rangle / R \to B$, it is sufficient to define a function $f$ from $G$ 
  to the underlying set of $B$ such that for every expression $\phi:R$, we have
  $\phi[x/f(x)] = 0_B$. 
\end{remark}
\begin{remark}
  For every element $x$ of $\langle G\rangle /R$ as above,
  there merely exists a finite subset of generators $G_0\subseteq G$ such that $x$ is expressable 
  as a Boolean combination of symbols from $G_0$. 
\end{remark}
\begin{definition}
  Let $B$ be a Boolean algebra. 
  If there exist $G, R$ as above such that 
  $B \simeq \langle G \rangle /R$, 
  we call $G,R$ respectively generators and relations for $B$. 
  %
  If $G,R$ can taken to be finite, we call $B$ finitely presented. 
  If $G,R$ can taken to be countable, we call $B$ countably presented. 
\end{definition}
\begin{remark}
  There is a category of Boolean algebras, which has a subcategory of countably presented Boolean algebras, 
  which has a subcategory of finitely presented Boolean algebras. 
\end{remark}
\begin{lemma}
  Every countably presented Boolean algebra merely is a colimit of a diagram of shape $\mathbb N$ 
  taking values in finitely presented Boolean algebras. 
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
  Consider $\langle G \rangle /R$ a countable presentation of a Boolean algebra $B$. 
  We will show there exists a diagram of shape $\mathbb N$ taking values in Boolean algebras 
  with $\langle G\rangle / R$ as the colimit.
  \paragraph{The diagram}
  Now let $R_n$ be the first $n$ terms in $R$. 
  Note that each of these finitely many terms uses only finitely many symbols from $G$.
  Let $G_n$ be the finite set of terms used in $R_n$, unioned with the finite set of the first $n$ elements of $G$. 
  Define for each $n\in\mathbb N$ the finitely presented Boolean algebra $B_n = G_n /R_n$. 
  If $n\leq m$, then \Cref{rmkMorphismsOutOfQuotient} gives us a map $B_n \to B_m$ 
  as $G_n \subseteq G_{n+1}$ and $R_n \subseteq R_{n+1}$. 
  Thus $(B_n)_{n\in \mathbb N}$ gives us a diagram of shape $\mathbb N$
  with values in finitely presented algebras. 

  \paragraph{The colimit}
  As $G_n\subseteq G$ and $R_n \subseteq R$, 
  \Cref{rmkMorphismsOutOfQuotient} also gives us a map $B_n\to \langle G \rangle /R$. 
  We claim the resulting cocone is a colimit. 

  Suppose we have a cocone $C$ on the diagram $(B_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}$. 
  We need to show that there exists a map $\langle G \rangle / R\to C$ and
  we need to show this map is unique as map between cocones. 
  \begin{itemize}
    \item To show there exists a map $\langle G \rangle / R \to C$, 
      we use remark \Cref{rmkMorphismsOutOfQuotient} again. 
      Let $g\in G$ be the $n$'th element of $G$, 
      note that $g\in G_n$, and consider the image of $g$ under the map $B_n \to C$. 
      This procedure defines a function from $G$ to the underlying set of $C$. 
      Let $\phi \in R$ be the $n$'th element of $R$, 
      note that $\phi \in R_n$, and the map $B_n \to C$ must send $\phi$ to $0$. 
      Thus the function from $G$ to the underlying set of $C$ also sends $\phi$ to $0$. 
      This thus defines a map $\langle G \rangle / R \to C$. 
    \item To show uniqueness, consider that any map of cocones must take the same values 
      on all $g\in G_n$ for all $n\in\mathbb N$, but by \Cref{rmkMorphismsOutOfQuotient}
      this uniquely defines a map. 
  \end{itemize}
\end{proof}
\begin{remark}
  Conversely, any colimit of a diagram of shape $\mathbb N$ of finite Boolean algebras 
  is a countably presented Boolean algebra with 
  as underlying sets of generators and relations the countable union of the finite sets of 
  generators and relations, which are both countable. 
\end{remark}

\subsection{Examples of countably presented Boolean algebras}
\begin{example}
  $2$ is the Boolean algebra given by the empty set of generators and no relations. 
    It's underlying set is $\{0,1\}$. 
\end{example}

\begin{example}
  $C = \langle N \rangle $ is the Boolean algebra given by $\mathbb N$ as set of generators and no relations. 
\end{example}
\begin{example}
  Denote $\mathbb N_{(co)fin}$ for the set of subsets of $\mathbb N$ which are finite or co-finite. 
  Under the interpretation of $\wedge = \cap , \vee = \cup, 0 = \emptyset, 1 = \mathbb N$, and $\neg$ 
  as the set-theoretic complemented (denoted $(\cdot)^C$). 

  These operations are well-defined on $\mathbb N_{(co)fin}$ 
  and they give the structure of a Boolean algebra (exercise for the reader if you don't believe me). 
  We claim it is countably presented. 

  Let $G = \{p_n| n:\mathbb N\} $ be a countably infinite set of generator symbols and let 
  $R = \{ p_n \wedge p_m | n\neq m :\mathbb N \}$. 
  We claim that $\langle G \rangle / R \simeq \mathbb N_{(co)fin}$. 

\begin{proof}
  We let $f:\langle G \rangle / R \to \mathbb N_{(co)fin}$, be the unique morphism of Boolean algebras 
  satisfying $f(p_n) = \{n\}$ for all $n:\mathbb N$. As $\{n\} \cap \{m\} = \emptyset$ whenever $n\neq m$, 
  \Cref{rmkMorphismsOutOfQuotient} indeed tells us this is sufficient to define $f$. 

  Now we define $g:\mathbb N_{(co)fin} \to \langle G \rangle / R$. 
  On a finite subset $I$, we define $g(I) = \bigvee_{i\in I} p_i$, 
  and on a cofinite subset $J$, we define $g(J) = \bigwedge _{i \in J^C} \neg p_i$. 
  Note that in these cases we indeed have $I,J^C$ are finite, so these are well-defined elements. 

  We need to show that $g$ is a Boolean morphism. 
  \begin{itemize}
    \item 
      By deMorgan's laws, $g$ preserves $\neg$:
      for $I$ finite we have
      \begin{equation}
      \neg g(I) = \neg (\bigvee_{i\in I} p_i) = \bigwedge_{i\in I} \neg p_i = g(I^C)
      \end{equation}
      And for $J$ cofinite, we apply similar reasoning. 
    \item To see that $g$ preserves $\vee$, we need to check three cases
      \begin{itemize}
        \item If both $I,J$ are finite, then 
        \begin{equation} 
          g(I \cup J) = \bigvee_{i\in I \cup J} p_i= \bigvee_{i\in I} p_i \vee \bigvee_{j\in J} p_j 
          = g(I) \vee g(J)
        \end{equation}
        and we're done. 
      \item If both $I,J$ are cofinite, we have
        \begin{equation}
          g(I) \vee g(J) = 
          \bigwedge_{i \in I^C} \neg p_i \vee 
          \bigwedge_{j \in J^C} \neg p_j 
          = 
          \bigwedge_{i\in I^C} 
          \bigwedge_{j \in J^C}(\neg p_i \vee  \neg p_j) 
        \end{equation}
        Now note that in $\langle G \rangle / R$, we have 
        \begin{equation}
          \neg p_i \vee \neg p_j = \neg ( p_i \wedge p_j) = 
          \begin{cases}
            p_i \text{ if } i = j\\
            1 \text{ if } i \neq j  
          \end{cases}
        \end{equation}
        Therefore, we can leave out the case that $i\neq j$ in the calculation of the above meet, and
        \begin{equation}
          \bigwedge_{i\in I^C} 
          \bigwedge_{j \in J^C}(\neg p_i \vee  \neg p_j)  
          = 
          \bigwedge_{i \in (I^C \cap J^C)} \neg p_i
          = 
          \bigwedge_{i \in (I \cup J)^C} \neg p_i 
        \end{equation}
        as $I\cup J$ must also be cofinite, this equals 
          $ g( I \cup J)$. 
        \item 
          If $I$ is finite and $J$ cofinite, we have 
          that $I\cup J$ is cofinite, hence 
          \begin{equation}
            g(I\cup J) = \bigwedge_{k\in (I \cup J)^C} \neg p_k
            = \bigwedge_{k \in (J^C -I)} \neg p_k
          \end{equation}
          Now note that 
          whenever $i\neq k$, we have 
          \begin{equation}
            p_i = (p_i \wedge \neg p_k) \vee (p_i \wedge p_k) = 
            (p_i \wedge \neg p_k) \vee 0 = p_i \wedge \neg p_k
          \end{equation}
          Hence by absorption
          \begin{equation} 
            (p_i \vee \neg p_k)  =
              \begin{cases}
                1 \text{ if } i = k \\
                \neg p_k \text{ if } i \neq k
              \end{cases}
          \end{equation}
          As for all $k\in J^C-I$ and all $i\in I$ we have $k\neq i$, we may thus write
          \begin{equation}
            \bigwedge_{k \in (J^C - I)} \neg p_k = 
            \bigwedge_{k \in (J^C - I)} (\neg p_k \vee (\bigvee_{i\in I} p_i))
          \end{equation}
          But now we can use that adding $1$ in a meet does not change the meet, and see that 
          \begin{equation}
            \bigwedge_{k \in (J^C - I)} (\neg p_k \vee (\bigvee_{i\in I} p_i))
            = 
            \bigwedge_{j \in J^C} (\neg p_j \vee (\bigvee_{i\in I} p_i))
          \end{equation}
          And using distributivity rules, we can see that 
          \begin{equation}
            \bigwedge_{j \in J^C} (\neg p_j \vee (\bigvee_{i\in I} p_i))
            = 
            (\bigwedge_{j \in J^C} \neg p_k) \vee (\bigvee_{i\in I} p_i)
          \end{equation}
          From which we may conclude that $g(I\cup J) = g(I) \cup g(J)$. 
      \end{itemize}
    \item The case for $\wedge$ is completely dual to the case for $\vee$. 
  \end{itemize}
We conclude that $g$ is a Boolean morphism. 
Furthermore, $g$ and $f$ are each other's inverse, thus the Boolean algebras are isomorphic. 
\end{proof}
\end{example}
