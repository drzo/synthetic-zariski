%\begin{abstract}
%In synthetic algebraic geometry (SAG) \cite{draft}, we study finitely presented algebras over a commutative ring. 
%In this work, we study countably presented Boolean algebras instead. 
%Where the finitely presented algebras over a commutative ring induce a Zariski topos, 
%%the opposite category of these 
%the countably presented Boolean algebras induce the topos of light condensed sets \cite{Scholze}. 
%\cite{draft} proposes an axiomatization of the Zariski topos in univalent homotopy type theory \cite{hott}. 
%In this work, we propose similar axioms, which we expect to be modelled by light condensed sets. 
%% Furthermore, spectra of countably presented Boolean algebras correspond to quotients of Cantor space
%% which is cool because reasons

\section{Boolean algebra}
\begin{definition}
  The language of Boolean algebras consists of
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Two symbols for constants $0,1$. 
    \item Two binary function symbols $\wedge, \vee$.
    \item One unary function symbol $\neg$. 
  \end{itemize}
\end{definition}
\begin{definition}
  The algebraic theory of Boolean algebras is as follows:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item We have axioms regarding order, sometimes called identity and absorption:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item $0 \wedge a = 0$. 
      \item $1 \wedge a = a$. 
      \item $0 \vee a = a$. 
      \item $1 \vee a = 1$. 
      \item $a \vee (a \wedge b) = a$
      \item $a \wedge (a \vee b) = a$. 
    \end{itemize}
    \item We have axioms regarding negations:
      \begin{itemize}
        \item $a \vee \neg a = 1$. 
        \item $a \wedge \neg a = 0$. 
        \item $\neg 1 = 0$. 
        \item $\neg \neg a = a$. 
      \end{itemize}
    \item We have axioms regarding commutativity and associativity:
      \begin{itemize}
        \item $a \vee b = b \vee a$. 
        \item $a \wedge b = b \wedge a$. 
        \item $(a \vee b) \vee c = a \vee (b \vee c)$. 
        \item $(a \wedge b) \wedge c = a \wedge (b \wedge c)$. 
      \end{itemize}
    \item We have axioms regarding distributivity:
      \begin{itemize}
        \item $a \vee (b \wedge c) = ( a \vee b) \wedge (a \vee c)$. 
        \item $a \wedge (b \vee c) = (a \wedge b) \vee ( a\wedge c)$. 
      \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
\end{definition}
\begin{remark}
We often denote $a \leq b$ and  $b \geq a$. Both of these mean that $a\wedge b = a$ and $ a\vee b = b$. 
Interpreting this notation as an order relation, we often think in the following terms:
\begin{itemize}
  \item $a\wedge b$ is the biggest element $c$ with $c \leq a$ and $c\leq b$.
  \item $a\vee b$ is the smallest element $c$ with $c \geq a$ and $c \geq b$. 
  \item $0$ is the smallest element. 
  \item $1$ is the biggest element. 
\end{itemize}
\end{remark}
\begin{definition}
  Given any set of symbols $G$, the free Boolean algebra on $G$, denoted $\langle G \rangle$
  is constructed as follows:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item We add $G$ as set of constants to the language of Boolean algebras. 
    \item We consider the set of terms in this language. 
    \item If there merely exists some finite sequence of 
      equalities from the theory of Boolean algebras allowing us to rewrite one term to another, 
      we consider the two terms to be equivalent. 
    \item The free Boolean algebra is then the set of equivalence classes under this relation. 
  \end{itemize}
\end{definition}
%\begin{remark}
%  So for every element $x$ in the free Boolean algebra of $G$, there merely exists
%  a finite subset $G_0\subseteq G$ such that we can express $x$ as Boolean combination of terms in $G_0$. 
%\end{remark}
%\begin{remark}
%  The free Boolean algebra is a Boolean algebra. 
%\end{remark}
\begin{definition}
  Let $G$ be a set of symbols. Consider $\Phi$ the set of terms in the language 
  given by adding $G$ as constants to the language of Boolean algebras. 
  Let $R \subseteq \Phi$. 
  we construct the quotient $\langle G \rangle / R$ as follows:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item We start with $\Phi$. 
    \item If there merely exists some finite sequence of 
      equalities from the theory of Boolean algebras or the set of equalities given by $\{\phi = 0 | \phi \in R\}$ 
      allowing us to rewrite one term to another, we consider the two terms to be equivalent. 
    \item The $\langle G \rangle / R$ is then the set of equivalence classes under this relation. 
  \end{itemize}
\end{definition}
\begin{definition}
  If $G,R$ are countable in the above definition, we call $\langle G \rangle /R$ 
  a \textbf{countably presented Boolean algebra}. 
  We call $G$ the set of generators and $R$ the set of relations. 
\end{definition}
\begin{remark}
  Countably presented Boolean algebras are Boolean algebras. 
\end{remark}
\begin{remark}
  For every element $x$ of a countably presented Boolean algebra, 
  there merely exists a finite subset of generators $G_0\subseteq G$ such that $x$ is expressable 
  as a Boolean combination of terms from $G_0$. 
\end{remark}

\subsection{Examples of countably presented Boolean algebras}
\begin{example}
  \item $2$ is the Boolean algebra given by the empty set of generators and no relations. 
    It's underlying set is $\{0,1\}$.
