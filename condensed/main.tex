\begin{abstract}
In synthetic algebraic geometry (SAG) \cite{draft}, we study finitely presented algebras over a commutative ring. 
In this work, we study countably presented Boolean algebras instead. 
Where the finitely presented algebras over a commutative ring induce a Zariski topos, 
%the opposite category of these 
the countably presented Boolean algebras induce the topos of light condensed sets \cite{Scholze}. 
\cite{draft} proposes an axiomatization of the Zariski topos in univalent homotopy type theory \cite{hott}. 
In this work, we propose similar axioms, which we expect to be modelled by light condensed sets. 
% Furthermore, spectra of countably presented Boolean algebras correspond to quotients of Cantor space
% which is cool because reasons
