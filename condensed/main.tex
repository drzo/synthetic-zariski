%\begin{abstract}
%In synthetic algebraic geometry (SAG) \cite{draft}, we study finitely presented algebras over a commutative ring. 
%In this work, we study countably presented Boolean algebras instead. 
%Where the finitely presented algebras over a commutative ring induce a Zariski topos, 
%%the opposite category of these 
%the countably presented Boolean algebras induce the topos of light condensed sets \cite{Scholze}. 
%\cite{draft} proposes an axiomatization of the Zariski topos in univalent homotopy type theory \cite{hott}. 
%In this work, we propose similar axioms, which we expect to be modelled by light condensed sets. 
%% Furthermore, spectra of countably presented Boolean algebras correspond to quotients of Cantor space
%% which is cool because reasons

\section{Boolean algebra}
\begin{definition}
  The language of Boolean algebras consists of
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Two symbols for constants $0,1$. 
    \item Two binary function symbols $\wedge, \vee$.
    \item One unary function symbol $\neg$. 
  \end{itemize}
\end{definition}
\begin{definition}
  The algebraic theory of Boolean algebras is as follows:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item We have axioms regarding order, sometimes called identity and absorption:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item $0 \wedge a = 0$. 
      \item $1 \wedge a = a$. 
      \item $0 \vee a = a$. 
      \item $1 \vee a = 1$. 
      \item $a \vee (a \wedge b) = a$
      \item $a \wedge (a \vee b) = a$. 
    \end{itemize}
    \item We have axioms regarding negations:
      \begin{itemize}
        \item $a \vee \neg a = 1$. 
        \item $a \wedge \neg a = 0$. 
        \item $\neg 1 = 0$. 
        \item $\neg \neg a = a$. 
      \end{itemize}
    \item We have axioms regarding commutativity and associativity:
      \begin{itemize}
        \item $a \vee b = b \vee a$. 
        \item $a \wedge b = b \wedge a$. 
        \item $(a \vee b) \vee c = a \vee (b \vee c)$. 
        \item $(a \wedge b) \wedge c = a \wedge (b \wedge c)$. 
      \end{itemize}
    \item We have axioms regarding distributivity:
      \begin{itemize}
        \item $a \vee (b \wedge c) = ( a \vee b) \wedge (a \vee c)$. 
        \item $a \wedge (b \vee c) = (a \wedge b) \vee ( a\wedge c)$. 
      \end{itemize}
    \item We have axioms called deMorgan's laws:
      \begin{itemize}
        \item $\neg (a \vee b ) = (\neg a) \wedge (\neg b)$. 
        \item $\neg (a \wedge b) = (\neg a) \vee (\neg b)$. 
      \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
\end{definition}
\begin{definition}
  Some language we will use is as follows:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item A Boolean algebra is a set-theoretic model of the theory of Boolean algebras. 
      It consists of a set $B$ and terms $0_B,1_B: B, \neg_B : B \to B, \vee_B, \wedge_B : B \times B \to B$ 
      satisfying the theory of Boolean algebras. 
      Sometimes we will leave out the subscript $(\cdot)_B$. 
    \item A morphism of Boolean algebra is a function between such sets preserving the operations above. 
      If $A,B$ are Boolean algebras, we write $A \to B$ for the type of such morphisms. 
%    \item We denote $id_B$ for the identity morphism $B \to B$. 
    \item If we have have two morphisms $f:A\to B , g : B \to A$ such that 
      $f\circ g (b) = b, g \circ f (a) = a$ for all $a:A, b:B$, 
      we say $A$ and $B$ are isomorphic and write $A \simeq B$. 
  \end{itemize}
\end{definition}
\begin{remark}
  We sometimes write $a \leq b$ and  $b \geq a$. Both of these mean that $a\wedge b = a$ and $ a\vee b = b$. 
  Interpreting this notation as an order relation, we often think in the following terms:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item $a\wedge b$ is the biggest element $c$ with $c \leq a$ and $c\leq b$.
    \item $a\vee b$ is the smallest element $c$ with $c \geq a$ and $c \geq b$. 
    \item $0$ is the smallest element. 
    \item $1$ is the biggest element. 
  \end{itemize}
\end{remark}
\begin{remark}
  For a family of expressions $x_i$ over a 
  finite set of indices $I = \{i_0, \cdots, i_n\}$, we will sometimes denote 
  \begin{itemize}
    \item $\bigvee_{i:I} x_i = x_{i_0} \vee \cdots \vee x_{i_n}$. 
    \item $\bigwedge_{i:I} x_i = x_{i_0} \wedge \cdots \wedge x_{i_n}$. 
  \end{itemize}
\end{remark}

\begin{definition}
  Let $\mathcal L$ be a language, 
  let $\phi,\psi$ be terms in any language,
  and suppose that for some index set $I$ we have 
  for each $i:I$ two terms $a_i,b_i$ of same sort in $\mathcal L$. 
  Let $E= (a_i = b_i)_{i:I}$. 

  We say that $E$ allows us to rewrite $\phi$ to $\psi$ if there is a finite list of expressions 
  $\phi = \phi_0 , \phi_1, \phi_2, \cdots, \phi_{n-1}, \phi_n = \psi$, 
  such that each $\phi_{n+1}$ is given by taking $\phi_n$ and either changing one occurence of $a_i$ to  $b_i$, 
  or one occurence of $b_i$ to $a_i$ for some $i:I$. 
\end{definition}


\begin{definition}
  Given any set of symbols $G$, the free Boolean algebra on $G$, denoted $\langle G \rangle$
  is constructed as follows:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item We add $G$ as set of constants to the language of Boolean algebras. 
    \item We consider the set of terms in this language. 
    \item If there merely exists some finite sequence of 
      equalities from the theory of Boolean algebras allowing us to rewrite one term to another, 
      we consider the two terms to be equivalent. 
    \item The free Boolean algebra is then the set of equivalence classes under this relation. 
  \end{itemize}
\end{definition}
%\begin{remark}
%  So for every element $x$ in the free Boolean algebra of $G$, there merely exists
%  a finite subset $G_0\subseteq G$ such that we can express $x$ as Boolean combination of terms in $G_0$. 
%\end{remark}
%\begin{remark}
%  The free Boolean algebra is a Boolean algebra. 
%\end{remark}
\begin{definition}
  Let $G$ be a set of symbols. Consider $\Phi$ the set of terms in the language 
  given by adding $G$ as constants to the language of Boolean algebras. 
  Let $R \subseteq \Phi$. 
  we construct the quotient $\langle G \rangle / R$ as follows:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item We start with $\Phi$. 
    \item If there merely exists some finite sequence of 
      equalities from the theory of Boolean algebras or the set of equalities $\{r = 0 | r \in R\}$ 
      allowing us to rewrite one term to another, we consider the two terms to be equivalent. 
    \item The $\langle G \rangle / R$ is then the set of equivalence classes under this relation. 
  \end{itemize}
\end{definition}
\begin{definition}
  A Boolean algebra is called \textbf{a countably presented Boolean algebra} iff there 
  can begiven countable sets $G,R$ as in the above definitions so that $B \simeq \langle G\rangle / R$. 
%  If $G,R$ are countable in the above definition, we call $\langle G \rangle /R$ 
%  a \textbf{countably presented Boolean algebra}. 
  We call $G$ the set of generators and $R$ the set of relations. 
\end{definition}
\begin{remark}
  Countably presented Boolean algebras are Boolean algebras. 
\end{remark}
\begin{remark}
  For every element $x$ of a countably presented Boolean algebra, 
  there merely exists a finite subset of generators $G_0\subseteq G$ such that $x$ is expressable 
  as a Boolean combination of terms from $G_0$. 
\end{remark}
\begin{remark}
  Let $B$ be a Boolean algebra, and let $\langle G \rangle / R$ be a countably presented Boolean algebra. 
  To define a morphism $\langle G \rangle / R$, it is sufficient to define a function $f$ from $G$ 
  to the underlying set of $B$ such that for every expression $\phi:R$, we have
  $\phi[x/f(x)] = 0_B$. 
\end{remark}

\subsection{Examples of countably presented Boolean algebras}
\begin{example}
  $2$ is the Boolean algebra given by the empty set of generators and no relations. 
    It's underlying set is $\{0,1\}$. 
\end{example}
\begin{example}
  $C = \langle N \rangle $ is the Boolean algebra given by $\mathbb N$ as set of generators and no relations. 
\end{example}
\begin{example}
  Denote $\mathbb N_{(co)fin}$ for the set of subsets of $\mathbb N$ which are finite or co-finite. 
  Under the interpretation of $\wedge = \cap , \vee = \cup, 0 = \emptyset, 1 = \mathbb N$, and $\neg$ 
  as the set-theoretic complemented (denoted $(\cdot)^C$). 

  These operations are well-defined on $\mathbb N_{(co)fin}$ 
  and they give the structure of a Boolean algebra (exercise for the reader if you don't believe me). 
  We claim it is countably presented. 

  Let $G = \{p_n| n:\mathbb N\} $ be a countably infinite set of generator symbols and let 
  $R = \{ p_n \wedge p_m | n\neq m :\mathbb N \}$. 
  We claim that $\langle G \rangle / R \simeq \mathbb N_{(co)fin}$. 

\begin{proof}
  We let $f:\langle G \rangle / R \to \mathbb N_{(co)fin}$, be the unique morphism of Boolean algebras 
  satisfying $f(p_n) = \{n\}$ for all $n:\mathbb N$.
  \rednote{More changes needed after here, not done yet, but proof was correct earlier}

  To go from finite/cofinite subsets of $\mathbb N$ to $B_\infty$,
  a finite subset $I$ of $\mathbb N$ is sent to the element 
  $\bigvee_{i \in I} p_i$, and a cofinite subset $J$ is sent to the element 
  $\bigwedge_{i \in J^C} \neg p_i$.  
  We call this function $g$ and we need to show that $g$ is a Boolean morphism. 
  \begin{itemize}
    \item By deMorgan's laws, $g$ preserves $\neg$. 
    \item To see that $g$ respects $\vee$, we need to check three cases
      \begin{itemize}
        \item If both $I,J$ are finite, then 
        \begin{equation} 
          g(I \cup J) = \bigvee_{i\in I \cup J} p_i= \bigvee_{i\in I} p_i \vee \bigvee_{j\in J} p_j 
        \end{equation}
      \item If both $I,J$ are cofinite, we have
        \begin{equation}
          g(I) \vee g(J) = 
          \bigwedge_{i \in I^C} \neg p_i \vee 
          \bigwedge_{j \in J^C} \neg p_j 
          = 
          \bigwedge_{i\in I^C} 
          \bigwedge_{j \in J^C}(\neg p_i \vee  \neg p_j) 
        \end{equation}
        Now note that $\neg p_i \vee \neg p_j = \neg ( p_i \wedge p_j)$, which 
        is $1$ if $i \neq j$ and $p_i$ if $i =j$. 
        We can leave $1$ out of the meet, and we are left with the intersection of $I^C$ and $J^C$, so
        \begin{equation}
          g(I) \vee g(J) = 
          \bigwedge_{i \in (I^C \cap J^C)} \neg p_i
          = 
          \bigwedge_{i \in (I \cup J)^C} \neg p_i 
        \end{equation} 
        as the union of $I$ and $J$ is also cofinite, this equals 
          $ g( I \cup J)$. 
        \item If $I$ is finite and $J$ cofinite, we have 
        \begin{equation}
        g(I) \vee g(J) = (\bigvee_{i\in I} p_i) \vee (\bigwedge_{j \in J^C} \neg p_j)
        = \bigwedge_{j \in J^C} (\bigvee_{i \in I}( p_i \vee \neg p_j))
        \end{equation}
        If $i\neq j$, then $p_i\wedge p_j = 0$, hence $\neg p_j \geq p_i$ and $p_i \vee \neg p_j  = \neg p_j$
        If $i = j$, then $p_i \vee \neg p_j = 1$.
%        \begin{equation}
%        g(I) \vee g(J) = 
%        = \bigwedge_{j \in J^C} (\bigvee_{i \in I-J}( p_i \vee \neg p_j))
%        \end{equation}
%
%        \item If $I$ is cofinite and $J$ is finite, we have that $I \cup J$ is cofinite.
%        Thus 
%        \begin{equation}
%          g(I \cup J) = \bigwedge_{i \in (I \cup J)^C} \neg p_i
%        \end{equation}
%
      \end{itemize}
    \item The case for $\wedge$ is completely dual to the case for $\vee$. 
  \end{itemize}
We conclude that $g$ is a Boolean morphism. 
Furthermore, $g$ and $f$ are clearly inverses, thus the Boolean algebras are isomorphic. 
\end{proof}
