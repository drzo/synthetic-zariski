\begin{definition}
  The Category $Pro(\mathcal C)$ has: 
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Objects: formal limits of diagrams over cofiltered categories. 
    \item Morphisms from $(S_i)_{i\in I}$ to $(T_j)_{j\in J}$ 
      are functions $\Pi_{j:J} \Sigma_{i \in I} S_i \to T_j$. 
      Two such functions $F,F'$ are equivalent iff 
      for any $j\in J$, $Fj = (i, f), F'j = (i',f')$
      we have an $i^0\in I$ with $i^0 \leq i, i'$
      such that
      \begin{equation}\begin{tikzcd}
        S_{i^0} \arrow[r] \arrow[d] & S_{i} \arrow[d,"f"]\\
        S_{i'} \arrow[r,"f'"'] & T_j
      \end{tikzcd}\end{equation}  
    \item Identities on $(S_i)_{i\in I}$ send $i$ to $(i,\id_{S_i})$. 
    \item Composition of 
      $F: (S_i)_{i \in I} \to (T_j)_{j\in J}$  and 
      $G: (T_j)_{j \in J} \to (U_k)_{k\in K}$
      for $G(k) = (j_k,g_k)$ and $F(j_k) = (i_k, f_k)$
      is given by $G\circ F (k) = (i_k , g_k \circ f_k)$.
  \end{itemize} 
\end{definition} 
\begin{lemma}
  The composition is well-defined. 
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
  Let $F,G$ be equivalent to $F', G'$ respectively. 
\end{proof}

TODO list
\begin{itemize}
  \item when is morphism an isomorphism? 
  \item Lemma: if the underlying cofiltered category $I$ of a pro-object $(S_i)_{i\in I}$ is countable, it can be replaced with $\mathbb N^{op}$
    in the sense that $(S_i)_{i\in I} \simeq (S'_i)_{i\in\mathbb N^{op}}$. 
\end{itemize}  


Remark We can see the limit as a the infinite branches of the forest with roots from X_0.
