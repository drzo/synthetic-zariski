\begin{abstract}
In synthetic algebraic geometry (SAG) \cite{draft}, we study finitely presented algebras over a commutative ring. 
In this work, we study countably presented Boolean algebras instead. 
Where the finitely presented algebras over a commutative ring induce a Zariski topos, 
%the opposite category of these 
the countably presented Boolean algebras induce the topos of light condensed sets \cite{TODO}. 
\cite{draft} proposes an axiomatization of the Zariski topos. 
In this work, we propose a similar axiomatization for light condensed sets. 
% Furthermore, spectra of countably presented Boolean algebras correspond to quotients of Cantor space
% which is cool because reasons

\subsection{Definitions}
\begin{definition}
  A countably presented Boolean algebra $B$ is a Boolean algebra such that there mererly are countable sets $I,J$, 
  a set of generators $(g_i)_{i\in I}$ and a set $(f_j)_{j\in J}$ of Boolean expressions over these generators 
  such that $B$ is equivalent to the quotient of the free Boolean algebra over the generators by the relations
  $(f_j=0)_{j\in J}$. 
\end{definition} 


In SAG, we deal with a fixed commutative ring $R$. For this project, the role of $R$ is taken over by 
the Boolean algebra $2 = 1+1$. Note that we don't need to postulate an alternative for the \textbf{Loc} axiom. 


\begin{definition}
  For $B$ a countably presented Boolean algebra, we define $Sp(B)$ as the set of Boolean morphisms from $B$ to $2$. 
  We assign a pointwise Boolean algebra structure on $Sp(B)$. 
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
  A type $X$ is called $Stone$ if it comes equiped with a Boolean algebra $B$ such that
  $X = Sp(B)$. 
\end{definition}



\subsection{Axioms}
\begin{axiom}[Stone duality]
  For any Boolean algebra $B$, there
  is an isomorphism of Boolean algebras
  $$B\simeq  2^{Sp(B)}.$$ 
\end{axiom} 
\begin{axiom}[Local choice]
  Whenever $X$ Stone and $E\twoheadrightarrow X$ surjective, then there is some $Y$ Stone,
    a surjection $Y \twoheadrightarrow X$ and a map $Y\to E$ such that the following diagram commutes:
    \begin{equation}\begin{tikzcd}
      E \arrow[d,""',two heads]\\
      X & \arrow[l, "", two heads] Y\arrow[lu, ""']
    \end{tikzcd}\end{equation}  
\end{axiom} 

\begin{axiom}
  A map $f:Sp(B)\to Sp(B')$ is surjective iff the corresponding map $B' \to B$ is injective.
\end{axiom}

%  By Stone duality, being Stone is a proposition.
