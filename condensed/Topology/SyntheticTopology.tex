\begin{lemma}[transitivity of openness]
  If $T$ is a type, $V\subseteq T$ is open and 
  $W\subseteq V$ is open, then the composite $W\subseteq V\subseteq T$ is also open.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
  According to \cite{SyntheticTopologyLesnik, p41}, 
  it is sufficient to check the condition for $T$ the type of propositions $\top$.
  An open subset of the type of propositions is classified by a map $\top \to \Open$, 
  and thus corresponds to an open proposition $P$. 
  An open subobject of $P$ is classified by a map $X:P\to \Open$, 
  and the proposition this classifies is given by $\Sigma_{p:P}X(p)$, 
  which is open by \Cref{OpenDependentSums}.
\end{proof}

\begin{remark}
  As the true proposition is open and openness is transitive, 
  $\Open$ can be called a dominance, see Proposition 2.25 of \cite{SyntheticTopologyLesnik}
\end{remark}

\begin{remark}
  Phao's principle is a special case of directed univalence.
