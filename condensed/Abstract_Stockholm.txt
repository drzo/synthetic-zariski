title: Synthetic Stone duality

abstract: We present an axiomatization for higher light condensed sets in HoTT-UF, similar to the axiomatization of the higher Zariski topos in synthetic algebraic geometry. In the resulting theory, we are able to prove the limited principle of omniscience and Markov's principle. However, the weak limited principle of omniscience is provably false. Furthermore, we have a definition of compact Hausdorff spaces and can show that all maps between compact Hausdorff spaces are continuous.
