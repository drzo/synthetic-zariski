\subsection{Principles of omniscience}
In constructive mathematics, we do not have general access to the law of excluded middle (LEM).
There are some principles that are weaker than LEM, which can be used to describe 
the proof-theoretic strength of a logical system, called principles of omniscience.
In this section, we will show that two of them (Markov's principle and LLPO) hold, 
and one (WLPO) fails in our system.

\begin{theorem}[The negation of the weak lesser principle of omniscience ($\neg$WLPO)]
  It is not the case that the statement %There is no method which given $\alpha:2^\mathbb N$ decides whether 
  $\forall_{n:\mathbb N} \alpha(n) = 0$ is decidable for general $\alpha:2^\mathbb N$. 
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
  Such a decission method would give a function $f:2^\mathbb N \to 2$ such that 
  $f(\alpha) = 0$ iff $\forall_{n:\mathbb N} \alpha (n)= 0$. 
  By Stone duality, there must be some $c:C$ with 
  $f(\alpha) = 0 \iff \alpha(c) = 0$. 
  $c$ is expressable using only finitely many generators $(p_n)_{n\leq N}$. 
  Now consider $\beta,\gamma:\langle C \rangle \to 2$ given by $\beta(p_n) = 0$ for all $n:\mathbb N$ and
  $\gamma(p_n) = 0$ iff $n\leq N$. 
  Note that these functions are equal on $(p_n)_{n\leq N}$, therefore, $\beta(c) = \gamma(c)$. 
  However, $f(\beta) = 0$ and $f(\gamma) = 1$.
  We thus have a contradiction, thus a decission method as required doesn't exist. 
\end{proof}

The following result is due to David W\"arn:
\begin{theorem}[Markov's principle (MP)]
  For $\alpha:\Noo$, we have that 
  \begin{equation}
    (\neg (\forall_{n:\mathbb N} \alpha (n)= 0)) \to \Sigma_{n:\mathbb N} \alpha (n)= 1
  \end{equation}
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
  Assume $\neg (\forall_{n:\mathbb N} \alpha (n)= 0)$.
%  Suppose $\alpha \neq \infty$.%, then it is not the case that $\alpha(n) = 0$ for all $n:\N$. 
  It is sufficient to show that $2/\{\alpha(n)|n\in\N\}$ is the trivial Boolean algebra. 
  It will then follow that there is a finite subset $N_0\subseteq \N$ 
  with $\bigvee_{i:N_0} \alpha(i) = 1$.
  As $\alpha(i) \in \{0,1\}$ and $\alpha(i) = 1$ for at most one $i$, it then follows that 
  there exists an unique $n\in\mathbb N$ with $\alpha(n) = 1$. 

  To show that $2/\{\alpha(n)|n\in\N\}$ is trivial, we will show it has an empty spectrum. 
  Suppose $x: 2 \to 2$ is such that $x(\alpha(n)) = 0$ for every $n:\N$. 
  As $x(1) = 1\neq_2 0$, we must have for every $n:\N$ that $\alpha(n) \neq 1$. 
  But then $\alpha(n) = 0$, contradicting our assumption. 
  We get a contradicition and there thus there are no terms of the spectrum of $2/\{\alpha(n)|n\in\N\}$ as required. 
\end{proof}
\begin{corollary}
  For $\alpha:2^\mathbb N$, we have that 
  \begin{equation}
    (\neg (\forall_{n:\mathbb N} \alpha (n)= 0)) \to \Sigma_{n:\mathbb N} \alpha (n)= 1
  \end{equation}
\end{corollary}
\begin{proof}
  Given $\alpha:2^\mathbb N$, consider the sequence $\alpha':\Noo$ satisfying $\alpha'(n) = 1$ iff 
  $n$ is minimal with $\alpha(n) = 1$. Then apply the above theorem.
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}[The lesser limited principle of omniscience (LLPO)]
  For $\alpha:\N_\infty$, 
  we have that 
  \begin{equation}\label{eqnLLPO}
    \forall_{k:\N} \alpha(2k) = 0  \vee \forall_{k:\N} \alpha(2k+1) = 0
  \end{equation}
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
%
%  We first will define a map $f:B_\infty \to B_\infty \times B_\infty$. 
%  Because of \Cref{rmkMorphismsOutOfQuotient}, it is sufficient to define $f$ on $(p_n)_{n:\N}$ with 
%  $f(p_n) \wedge f(p_m) = (0,0)$ for $n\neq m$. 
%  To define $f(p_n)$, we use a case distinction on whether $n$ is odd or even. 
  Define $f:B_\infty \to B_\infty \times B_\infty$ as follows:
  \begin{equation}
    f(p_n) =\begin{cases}
      (p_k,0) \text{ if } n = 2k\\
      (0,p_k) \text{ if } n = 2k+1\\
    \end{cases}
  \end{equation}
  By making a case distinction on $n,m$ being odd or even, 
  we can see that 
  $f(p_n) \wedge f(p_m) = (0,0)$ when $n\neq m$, thus $f$ is well-defined. 
  We also claim it is injective.
  Now let $x:B_\infty$ with $f(x) = 0$. 
  We denote $E,O\subseteq \N$ for the even and odd numbers, 
  and we make a case distincition based on \Cref{BinftyTermsWriting}.
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Suppose 
      $x = \bigvee_{i\in I_0} p_i$. 
      Then 
      $$f(x) = (\bigvee_{i\in I_0 \cap E } p_{\frac i2} , \bigvee_{i\in I_0 \cap O } p_{\frac {i-1}2} ) = (0,0)$$
      But now as $p_j\neq 0$ for all $j\in\N$, we must have $I_0 \cap E = \emptyset = I_0 \cap O$. 
      Thus $I_0= \emptyset$, and $x = 0$. 
    \item Suppose 
%      Let $x$ correspond to a cofinite subset of $\N$. Write 
      $x = \bigwedge_{j\in J} \neg p_j$. % for $J$ finite. 
      We will derive a contradiction. %, from which we can conclude that $x=0$ after all. 
      Note that   
      $$f(x) = (\bigwedge_{j\in J \cap E } \neg p_j , \bigwedge_{j\in J \cap O } \neg p_j )$$
      As $f(x) = (0,0)$, we have that 
      $\bigwedge_{j\in J \cap E } \neg p_j =0$ and
      $\bigwedge_{j\in J \cap O } \neg p_j  = 0$.
      However, any finite meet of negations will correspond to a cofinite set,
      in particular not to the empty set, giving a contradiction. 
  \end{itemize}
  In both cases, we conclude $x=0$, thus $f$ is injective. 
  By \Cref{FormalSurjectionsAreSurjections}, $f$ corresponds to a surjection 
  $s:\Noo + \Noo \to \Noo$.
  Now let $\alpha : \Noo$, 
  let $x:\Noo + \Noo$ be such that $s x = \alpha$. 
  If $x = inl(\beta)$, 
  for any $k:\N$, we have that 
  $$\alpha (p_{2k+1}) = s(x) (p_{2k+1}) = x(f(p_{2k+1})) = inl(\beta) (0,p_k)  = \beta(0) = 0.$$
  Similarly, if $x = inr(\beta)$, we have $\alpha(p_{2k}) = 0$ for all $k:\N$. 
  Thus $\Cref{eqnLLPO}$ holds for $\alpha$ as required. 
\end{proof}
