Following \cite{Hartshorne}[Theorem 5.1, Chapter III] we can apply \v{C}ech cohomology to compute
the cohomology of Serre's twisting sheaves on $\bP^n$.

\begin{definition}
  The ring $R[X_0,\dots,X_n]$ as well as its localizations by monomials is a graded ring, where the degree $d:\Z$ elements are homogenous rational functions of degree $d$.
  We denote the $R$-module of degree $d$ elements of $R[X_0,\dots,X_n]_{X_{i_0}\dots X_{i_p}}$ by
  \[
    \left(R[X_0,\dots,X_n]_{X_{i_0}\dots X_{i_p}}\right)_d
    \rlap{.}
  \]
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}
  \begin{enumerate}[(i)]
  \item For $n:\N$, $d:\Z$, the canonical map $R[X_0,\dots,X_n]_d\to H^0(\bP^n,\mathcal O(d))$ is an isomorphism of $R$-modules.
  \item $H^n(\bP^n,\mathcal O(-n-1))=R$ is free of rank 1 and $H^n(\bP^n,\mathcal O(d))=0$ for $d>-n-1$.
  \item The canonical map given by tensoring
    \[
      H^0(\bP^n,\mathcal O(d)) \times H^n(\bP^n,\mathcal O(-d-n-1))\to R
    \]
    is a perfect pairing of finite free $R$-modules for all $d:\Z$.
  \item $H^i(\bP^n,\mathcal O(d))=0, 0<i<n, d:\Z$.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
  We cover $\bP^n$ by the affine open subschemes $U_i\colonequiv D(X_i)$.
  More generally, we use the shorthand $U_{i_0\dots i_p}\colonequiv D(X_{i_0}\dots X_{i_p})$
  and note
  \[
    \mathcal O(d)(U_{i_0\dots i_p})=\left(R[X_0,\dots,X_n]_{X_{i_0}\dots X_{i_p}}\right)_d
    \rlap{.}
  \]
  The \v{C}ech complex for this covering is
  \[
    \prod_{i_0}\left(R[X_0,\dots,X_n]_{X_{i_0}}\right)_d \to \prod_{i_0,i_1} \left(R[X_0,\dots,X_n]_{X_{i_0} X_{i_1}}\right)_d \to \dots \to \left(R[X_0,\dots,X_n]_{X_0\dots X_n}\right)_d
    \rlap{.}
  \]
  \begin{enumerate}[(i)]
  \item $H^0(\bP^n,\mathcal O(d))$ is the kernel of the first map in the \v{C}ech complex,
    so it consists of all families
    \[
      C=\left(\frac{P_i}{X_{i}^{l_i}}\right)_{i:\{0,\dots,n\}}
    \]
    of degree $d$ elements such that $X_i^{l_i}P_j=X_j^{l_j}P_i$ by regularity of $X_k$, $k=0,\dots,n$.
    Again by regularity and using this equation, $P_i$ is divisible by $X_i^{l_i}$, so $C$ was a family with values in $R[X_0,\dots,X_n]_d$.
  \item $H^n(\bP^n,\mathcal O(d))$ is the cokernel of the map
    \[
      \prod_{i} \left(R[X_0,\dots,X_n]_{X_0\dots \hat{X_i}\dots X_n}\right)_d \to \left(R[X_0,\dots,X_n]_{X_0\dots X_n}\right)_d
      \rlap{.}
    \]
    The image of this map is freely generated by all degree $d$ monomials $X_0^{l_0}\dots X_n^{l_n}$ where $l_i\geq 0$ for some $i$.
    This means the cokernel is generated by all degree $d$ monomials $X_0^{l_0}\dots X_n^{l_n}$ with $l_i<0$ for all $i$.
    For $d= -n-1$ the only possibility is $l_i=-1$ for all $i$, so $H^n(\bP^n,\mathcal O(-n-1))$ is freely generated by this monomial.
    For larger $d$, there is no such monomial and we have $H^n(\bP^n,\mathcal O(d))=0$.
