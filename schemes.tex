In \cref{def:schemes} we defined a scheme to be a type $X$ such that $X$
may be covered by finitely many open affine subtypes.
In this section, we will present a couple of common constructions for schemes.

\subsection{Glueing}
\begin{proposition}%
  Let $X,Y$ be schemes and $f:U\to X$, $g:U\to Y$ be embeddings with open images in $X$ and $Y$,
  then the pushout of $f$ and $g$ is a scheme.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
  As we noted in \cref{MISSING}, such a pushout is always 0-truncated.
  Let $U_1,\dots,U_n$ be a cover of $X$ and $V_1,\dots,V_m$ be a cover of $Y$.
  For each $U_i$, let us identify $U$ with $\sum_{x:Y}U(x)$, then there is a subtype
  \[ W_i\colonequiv (x:Y)\mapsto \sum_{z:U(x)}U_i(f(z)) \]
  of $Y$.
\end{proof}
