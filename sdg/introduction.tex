In synthetic algebraic geometry, it was discovered that a local choice axiom giving access to the topology of the topos one is working in is very helpful.
This is an experiment aiming for a similar setup for synthetic differential geometry.
It seems to be a good idea to start with generalizing the Kock-Lawvere axiom and looking at different notions of openness.
