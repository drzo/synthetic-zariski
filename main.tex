\section{Axioms}

We always assume there is a commutative ring $R$.
Sometimes we will assume $R$ has additional properties, or, more generally,
axioms hold that involve $R$.
We will always mention which of these axiom are needed to prove each statement,
by listing the shorthands introduced in the axioms below.

\begin{axiom}[Loc]%
  \label{loc}
  $R$ is a local ring.
\end{axiom}

\begin{axiom}[SQC]%
  \label{sqc}
  For any finitely presented $R$-algebra $A$, the homomorphism
  \[ a \mapsto (\varphi\mapsto \varphi(a)) : A \to (\Spec A \to R)\]
  is an isomorphism of $R$-algebras.
\end{axiom}

\begin{axiom}[Z-choice]%
  \label{Z-choice}
  Let $A$ be a finitely presented $R$-algebra
  and let $B : \Spec A \to \mU$ be a family of inhabited types.
  Then there merely exists
  a finite list of coprime elements $f_1, \dots, f_n \in A$
  together with dependent functions $s_i : \Pi_{x : D(f_i)} B(x)$.
  As a formula:
  \[ (\Pi_{x : \Spec A} \propTrunc{B(x)}) \to
     \propTrunc{ \Sigma_{n : \N} \Sigma_{f_1, \dots, f_n : A}
      ((f_1, \dots, f_n) = (1)) \times
      \Pi_i \Pi_{x : D(f_i)} B(x) }
     \rlap{.}
  \]
\end{axiom}

  AUGSBURG IDEAS:

  * Spec k[[X]] = D
  * Pushout of two schemes along open subscheme is scheme
  * for V : X \to R-Vect-n \bP(V) is scheme
  * P as space of line (in some vector space)
  * open/closed subsets are D(f) with values in a line bundle
  * define separated schemes, compare with 'inequality is an apartness relation'
  * separated => inequality is apartness  
  * define intersection (of curves) as pullbacks
  * define finite schemes
  * show good intersections are finite schemes?
  * show that dim (R^(intersection)) is the right thing (in examples)
    e.g. for curves in 2-dim. projective space, it should be the product of the degrees
  * irreducibility: (X irred :<=> (X=A∪B => X=A ∨ X=B)) shown for A^1, counterexample D(XY)
