  AUGSBURG IDEAS:

  * Spec k[[X]] = D
  * Pushout of two schemes along open subscheme is scheme
  * for V : X \to R-Vect-n \bP(V) is scheme
  * P as space of line (in some vector space)
  * open/closed subsets are D(f) with values in a line bundle
  * define separated schemes, compare with 'inequality is an apartness relation'
  * separated => inequality is apartness  
  * define intersection (of curves) as pullbacks
  * define finite schemes
  * show good intersections are finite schemes?
  * show that dim (R^(intersection)) is the right thing (in examples)
    e.g. for curves in 2-dim. projective space, it should be the product of the degrees
  * irreducibility: (X irred :<=> (X=A∪B => X=A ∨ X=B)) shown for A^1, counterexample D(XY)

\begin{example}
  The ring $R$ is a local ring, so we have
  $\Pi_{x \in R} \propTrunc{\inv(x) \lor \inv(1 - x)}$,
  but we can prove that
  the statement without the propositional truncation is false:
  \[ \lnot \Pi_{x \in R} (\inv(x) \amalg \inv(1 - x)) \rlap{.} \]
  Namely,
  a witness of $\Pi_{x \in R} (\inv(x) \amalg \inv(1 - x))$
  is equivalently a function $f : R \to \Bool$
  with the property that
  \[ \text{if $f(x)$ then $\inv(x)$ else $\inv(1 - x)$} \rlap{.} \]
  But by Proposition $\ref{proposition:A1-connected}$,
  the function $f$ must be constant,
  contradicting the fact that
  $\lnot\inv(x)$ for $x = 0$ and $\lnot\inv(1 - x)$ for $x = 1$.

  In particular,
  not every type family $B : \A^1 \to \mU$ with $\Pi_{x : \A^1} \propTrunc{B(x)}$
  merely admits a choice function $\Pi_{x : \A^1} B(x)$.
\end{example}

\begin{axiom}[Z-choice]%
  \label{Z-choice}
  Let $A$ be a finitely presented $R$-algebra
  and let $B : \Spec A \to \mU$ be a family of inhabited types.
  Then there merely exists
  a finite list of coprime elements $f_1, \dots, f_n \in A$
  together with dependent functions $s_i : \Pi_{x : D(f_i)} B(x)$.
  As a formula:
  \[ (\Pi_{x : \Spec A} \propTrunc{B(x)}) \to
     \propTrunc{ \Sigma_{n : \N} \Sigma_{f_1, \dots, f_n : A}
      ((f_1, \dots, f_n) = (1)) \times
      \Pi_i \Pi_{x : D(f_i)} B(x) }
     \rlap{.}
  \]
\end{axiom}

\begin{theorem}[using (\axiomref{loc}), (\axiomref{sqc})]%
  Let $A$ be a finitely presented $R$-algebra.
  Then every function $f : \Spec A \to \N$ is bounded:
  \[ \Pi_{f : \Spec A \to \N} \propTrunc{\Sigma_{n : \N} \Pi_{x : \Spec A} f(x) \le n}
     \rlap{.} \]
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
  Let $f : \Spec A \to \N$ be given.
  We compose this function with the embedding
  \[ \begin{tikzcd}[row sep=0mm]
    \N \ar[r, "\iota"] & R[X] \ar[r, phantom, "{=}"] & (\bA^1 \to R) \\
    n \ar[r, mapsto] & X^n
  \end{tikzcd} \]
  (it is an embedding since $1 \neq 0 \in R$ by (\axiomref{loc}))
  to obtain $\widetilde{f} : \Spec A \to (\bA^1 \to R)$
  and its transpose $g : \Spec A \times \bA^1 \to R$.
  Since $\Spec A \times \bA^1 = \Spec (A \otimes R[X]) = \Spec A[X]$
  (see~\ref{MISSING}),
  we can regard $g$ as an element of $A[X]$.
  For $x \in \Spec A$,
  the polynomial $\iota(f(x)) \in R[X]$ is then obtained from the polynomial~$g$
  by applying the $R$-algebra homomorphism $x : A \to R$ to all coefficients.
  This makes it clear that
  we have a common bound on the degrees of the polynomials $\iota(f(x))$,
  in other words,
  the function $f$ is bounded.
\end{proof}

The following example shows that we can not expect all affine schemes
to be compact with respect to arbitrary set-indexed open coverings.

\begin{example}
  For $A$ a finitely presented $R$-algebra,
  consider the open cover ${(U_i)}_{i \in I}$,
  where the index set is $I = \Spec A$
  and for each $i$ we set $U_i = \Spec A = D(1)$.
  This indeed covers all points of $\Spec A$,
  since for every $x \in \Spec A$ we clearly have $x \in U_x$.
  To give a finite subcover of this cover, however,
  means to give a natural number $n$ and a function $\Fin n \to \Spec A$
  with the property that $\Spec A$ is empty if $n = 0$.
  In essence, it means to decide whether $\Spec A$ is inhabited or not.
  We claim that this is not possible for all finitely presented $R$-algebras:
  \[ \lnot (\Pi_{A : f.p. R\text{-Alg}} \propTrunc{\Spec A \amalg \lnot \Spec A} )
     \rlap{.} \]
  Indeed, for $A = R/(x)$,
  the proposition $\propTrunc{\Spec A \amalg \lnot \Spec A}$
  means $x = 0 \lor x \neq 0$,
  and we saw in~\ref{MISSING} that this is not true for all $x \in R$.
