The following is work in progress (of Felix Cherubini, Thierry Coquand and Matthias  Hutzler) on a development of algebraic geometry, internal to the Zariski topos, building on the work of Kock and Blechschmidt (\cite{MISSING}, \cite{ingo-thesis}).
The Zariski topos consists of sheaves on the site opposite to the category of finitely presented algebras over a fixed ring, with the Zariski topology, i.e. generating covers are given by localization maps $A\to A_{f_1}$ for finitely many elements $f_1,\dots,f_n$ that generate the ideal $(1)=A\subseteq A$.

Since we use HoTT, we need a higher version of these sheaves.
One innovation we present, is the use of higher types to define and reason about cohomology.
Actually computing cohomology groups, seems to need a principle along the lines of our ``Zariski local choice'' axiom.
