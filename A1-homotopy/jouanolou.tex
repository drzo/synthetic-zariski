The goal here is to prove that as many schemes as possible are $\A^1$-equivalent to an affine scheme. We do not go as general as the general theorem. We roughly follow [Homotopy Algebraic $K$-theory by Weibel].

\begin{definition}
An affine vector bundle torsor over a scheme $X$ consists of an affine scheme $W$ with a map:
\[p:W\to X\]
such that there exists a vector bundle $E$ over $X$ with $p$ an $E$-torsor.
\end{definition}

\begin{remark}\label{vector-torsor-equivalence}
An affine vector bundle torsor:
\[W\to X\]
 has $\A^1$-connected fibers. So it is an $\A^1$-equivalence.
\end{remark}

\begin{lemma}
There exists an affine vector bundle torsor over $\bP^n$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
TODO
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
Let $p$ be an affine map between schemes. Then the pullback of an affine vector bundle torsor along $p$ is an affine vector bundle torsor.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Immediate, as affine schemes are closed under dependent product.
\end{proof}

The previous two lemmas cover projective schemes. TODO extend to quasi-projective, I think Felix knows how.

\begin{remark}
This result can be extended to any scheme with an ample family of line bundle (Jouanolou-Thomason Theorem).
\end{remark}
