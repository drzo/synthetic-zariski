We present some sketches of synthetic linear algebra.

\begin{lemma}\label{inf-has-choice}
Let $X$ be an infinitesimal variety. Then choice over $X$ is valid:
for any type family $P$ with $(x : X) \to \propTrunc{P(x)}$,
we have $\propTrunc{(x : X) \to P(x)}$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
By Zariski local choice, it suffices to show that every Zariski cover
of $X \to R$ is trivial, that is that $X \to R$ is a local ring.
Indeed this is the case, since the evaluation $(X \to R) \to R$
reflects invertible elements.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
In the category of finitely co-presented $R$-modules, every object is projective.
That is, if $M,N,L$ are finitely co-presented $R$-modules,
$f : M \to L$ is $R$-linear and $g : N \to L$ is $R$-linear and surjective,
then there merely exists $h : M \to N$ such that $f = g \circ h$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
We apply \cref{inf-has-choice} to obtain
$(m : \D(M^\star)) \to (n : N) \times g(n) = f(m)$.
That is, we have $h_0 : \D(M^\star) \to N$ such that $f = g \circ h_0$ on $\D(M)$.
Without loss of generality, $h_0(0) = 0$; otherwise we may replace $h_0$
by $h_0 - h_0(0)$, since in any case $g(h_0(0)) = f(0) = 0$.
Now $h_0$ lifts to a pointed map $\D(M^\star) \to_\pt \D(N^\star)$.
This corresponds to an $R$-linear map $N^\star \to M^\star$, and hence to
an $R$-linear map $M \to N$, as desired.
\end{proof}

In particular, since $R$ is a local ring, we have that if $M$ is finitely co-presented and
finitely generated, then $M$ is free.
