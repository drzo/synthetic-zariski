\paragraph{Exercise 1}{
Show that any map in: 
\[\bP^1 \to R\]
is constant.
}

Hint: Present $\bP^1$ as a pushout $\A^1\coprod_{\A^\times}\A^1$, then compute $R^{\bP^1}$ as a pullback.

\paragraph{Exercise 2}{
Assume given $x,y:\bP^n$ such that $x\not=y$. Prove there is a map:
\[\psi: \bP^1 \to \bP^n\]
such that $\psi([1:0]) = x$ and $\psi([0:1]) = y$.
}

\paragraph{Exercise 3}{
Show that any map in: 
\[\bP^n \to R\]
is constant. Deduce that $\bP^n$ is not affine for any $n>0$.
}

Hint: You can prove that for any $x:\bP^n$ we have that $x\not=[1:0:0:\cdots:0]$ or $x\not=[0:1:0:\cdots:0]$.
