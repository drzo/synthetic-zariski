\paragraph{Exercise 1}{
Let $I$ be a f.g. ideal and let $P$ be the closed proposition $I=0$. Show that we have $\neg\neg P$ if and only if $I$ is nilpotent.}

\begin{definition}
For any type $X$, a subtype $P\subset X$ is called dense if for any open subtype $U\subset X$ we have that $U\cap P = \emptyset$ implies $U=\emptyset$
\end{definition}

\paragraph{Exercise 1.5 (HoTT only)}{
Recall that giving a subtype $P\subset X$ is equivalent to giving a map $X\to \mathrm{Prop}$. Reformulate the definition of dense using maps to $\mathrm{Prop}$.
}

\paragraph{Exercise 2}{
Let $X$ be any type with a closed subtype $C:X\to \mathrm{Closed}$. Show that $C\subset X$ is dense if and only:
\[\prod_{x:X}\neg\neg C(x)\]
}

\paragraph{Exercise 3}{
Assume that $A$ is a f.p. algebra and $I$ a f.g. $A$-ideal. Show that the subscheme:
\[\Spec(A/I)\subset \Spec(A)\]
is closed. Show that it is dense if and only if $I$ is nilpotent.
