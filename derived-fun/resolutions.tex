\begin{definition}
  Let $X,Y$ be schemes and.
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item For $M:Y\to\Mod{R}$ and $f:X\to Y$ let $f^*M:\equiv (x:X)\mapsto M_{f(x)}$.
  \item For $M:X\to\Mod{R}$ and $f:X\to Y$ let $f_*M:\equiv (y:Y)\mapsto \prod_{x:\fib_f(y)}M_{\pi_1(x)}$.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{definition}

Both operations preserve weakly quasi coherent modules by \cite{draft}[Theorem 9.1.11].
At the heart of the construction of local resolutions below,
is what is called \notion{Zariski-local choice} in \cite{draft} and justified as an axiom there.
A special case is local-triviality of gerbes:

\begin{axiom}
  Let $X=\Spec A$ be an affine scheme and $M:X\to\Mod{R}$.
  For $n>0$ and each $G:\prod_{x:X}K(M_x,n)$ there merely is a Zariski cover,
  i.e. coprime
  $f_1,\dots,f_n:A$ such that on each subtype $D(f_i):\equiv (x:X)\mapsto D(f_i(x))$,
  $G$ is trivial.
\end{axiom}

With that, there merely are finite covers of schemes trivializing any $M$-gerbe $G$.
Let us denote the coproduct of such a cover with $U_G$,
so we have a surjection $u_G:U_G\to X$ such that $\prod_{x:U_G}G_x=M_x$.
If we started with a weakly quasi coherent $M$,
we get an injective map of weakly quasi coherent modules:
\[
  M_x \to M_x^{\fib_{u_G}(x)}
\]
where the domain is weakly quasi coherent, since it is $({u_G}_*u_G^*M)_x$.

To get a resolution from that, we need to see that cokernels of monomorphisms
of weakly quasi coherent modules are weakly quasi coherent.
In symbols, for $N\subseteq M$ one of those morphisms, we need:
\[
  (M/N)_f=(M/N)^{D(f)}.
\]
by algebra $(M/N)_f=M_f/N_f$.
This means we are done, if $(M/N)^{D(f)}=M^{D(f)}/{N^{D(f)}}$.
To see this holds, let us consider $0\to N\to M\to M/N\to 0$ as a short exact sequence of dependent modules,
over the subtype of the point $D(f)\subseteq 1=\Spec R$.
Then, taking global sections, we have an exact sequence
\[
 0\to N^{D(f)}\to M^{D(f)}\to (M/N)^{D(f)}\to H^1(D(f),M)
\]
-- but $D(f)=\Spec R_f$ is affine,
so the last term is 0 and $(M/N)^{D(f)}$ is the cokernel $M^{D(f)}/N^{D(f)}$.
So we know that dependent wqc modules over a scheme,
always merely have local resolutions consisting of dependent wqc modules.

By \cref{vanishing-conjecture},
the types $K(M_x,n)^{U_\chi}$, where $M_x$ is wqc and $n>0$ are $0$-connected
-- note that $M_x$ is weakly quasi coherent on $U_\chi$, since it is the push-forwad
of $M_x$ along the map $U_\chi\to 1$.

This means that $\left(K(M_x,n)^{U_\chi}\right)_{n:\N}$ is an Eilenberg-MacLane spectrum.
So we have found resolving sequences for all gerbes on a scheme with coefficients in weakly quasic coherent modules.
