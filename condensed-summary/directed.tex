Based on Barton-Commelin axioms. Going toward:

\begin{definition}
A type is overtly discrete if it merely is a sequential colimit of finite type.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
A proposition is open if it is overtly discrete.
\end{definition}

Open propositions are precisely countable disjunction of decidable propositions.

\begin{theorem}
Given $X,Y:\mathrm{ODisc}$, the fiber of the map:
\[ (\mathrm{Open}\to \mathrm{ODisc}) \to \mathrm{ODisc}\times \mathrm{ODisc}\]
\[ P \mapsto (P(\bot),P(\top))\]
over $(X,Y)$ is:
\[X\to Y\]
\end{theorem}

Intuitively this means that the type of open propositions is a directed interval for overtly discrete types.
