\begin{theorem}
  If $B$ is a Boolean algebra we have $B:\Boole$ iff $B = \varinjlim B_n$ with $B_n$ finite Boolean algebra.
  We have $S:\Stone$ iff $S = \varprojlim S_n$ with $S_n$ finite sets.
\end{theorem}

\begin{theorem}
  If $S:\Stone$, a subset $F:\Stone$ is a countable intersection of decidable subsets iff it is classified by $\Closed$.
  It is a countable disjunction of decidable subsets iff it is classified by $\Open$.
  If $S:\Stone$ and $x_0,x_1:S$ then $x_0 =_S x_1$ is closed. If $P$ is a proposition then $P:\Closed$ iff $P:\Stone$ iff
  $P:\CHaus$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{theorem}
  If $X:\CHaus$ with a surjective map $S\rightarrow X$ with $S\times_X S:\Stone$, a subset of $X$ is classified
  by a $\Closed$ iff it is the image of a closed subset of $S$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{definition}
  The unit interval $[0,1]$ is the image of Cantor space by the map $\alpha\mapsto \Sigma_n \alpha(n)/2^n$.
\end{definition}


Any map $f:Y\rightarrow X$ is continuous in the sense that the inverse image of an open subset of $X$ is an open
subset of $Y$.

\begin{theorem}
  If $S:\Stone$ two disjoint closed subsets of $S$ are separated by a decidable subset. If $X:\CHaus$ and $A,B$ are
  two disjoint closed subsets of $X$, then there exists disjoint open subsets $U,V$ of $X$ such that $A\subseteq U$
  and $B\subseteq V$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{theorem}
  If $X:\CHaus$ and $F_n$ is a decreasing sequence of closed subsets of $X$ such that $\cap_n F_n = \emptyset$
  then there exists $n$ such that $F_n = \emptyset$. If $U_n$ is an increasing sequence of open subsets of $X$
  such that $X = \cup_n U_n$ then there exists $n$ such that $X = U_n$.  
\end{theorem}
