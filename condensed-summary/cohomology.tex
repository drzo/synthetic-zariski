Going toward:

\begin{theorem}
Let $S$ be a Stone space and $A_x$ be an overtly discrete abelian group depending on $x:S$. Then for all $i>0$ we have that:
\[H^i(S,A) = 0\]
\end{theorem}

\begin{proposition}
Let $A_x$ be an overtly discrete abelian group depending on $x:\mathbb{I}$. Then for all $i>0$ we have that:
\[H^i(\mathbb I,A) = 0\]
\end{proposition}

We expect to be able to prove that cohomology with value in overtly discrete abelian groups is well-behaved on CW complex.
