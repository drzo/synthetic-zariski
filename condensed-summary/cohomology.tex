\begin{theorem}
Let $S$ be a Stone space, then for all $i>0$ we have \[H^i(S,\ints) = 0\]
\end{theorem}

If $X:\CHaus$ and $S:\Stone$ with $S\rightarrow X$ surjective, of fiber $S_x$ for $x:X$,  we can consider the cochain complex
\[\Pi_{x:X}\ints^{S_x}\rightarrow \Pi_{x:X}\ints^{S_x\times S_x}\rightarrow \Pi_{x:X}\ints^{S_x\times S_x\times S_x}\rightarrow\dots\]
then the cohomology groups $H^n(X,\ints)$, in the sense of univalent type theory, are exactly the cohomology groups of this
cochain complex. In particular, we have the following.

\begin{proposition}
For all $i>0$ we have \[H^i([0,1],\ints) = 0\]
\end{proposition}





%We expect to be able to prove that cohomology with value in overtly discrete abelian groups is well-behaved on CW complex.
