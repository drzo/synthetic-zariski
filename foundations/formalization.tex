There is a formalization of a small part of this work, in particular,
the proof that projective $n$-space $\bP^n$ is a scheme has been formalized.

It makes extensive use of the algebra part of the cubical-agda library:

-- which contains many contributions, in particular,
on finitely presented algebras and related concepts,
which where made in the scope of this project.
