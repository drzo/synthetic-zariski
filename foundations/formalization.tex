There is a related formalization project, which, at the time of writing,
contains the construction of projective $n$-space $\bP^n$ as a scheme.
The code may be found here:

It makes extensive use of the algebra part of the cubical-agda library:

-- which contains many contributions, in particular,
on finitely presented algebras and related concepts,
which where made in the scope of that project.
