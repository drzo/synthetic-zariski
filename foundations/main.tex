\begin{abstract}
  The following is work in progress on a development of algebraic geometry, internal to the Zariski topos, building on the work of Kock and Blechschmidt (\cite{kock-sdg}[I.12], \cite{ingo-thesis}).
  The Zariski topos consists of sheaves on the site opposite to the category of finitely presented algebras over a fixed ring, with the Zariski topology, i.e. generating covers are given by localization maps $A\to A_{f_1}$ for finitely many elements $f_1,\dots,f_n$ that generate the ideal $(1)=A\subseteq A$.

  Since we use HoTT, we need a higher version of these sheaves.
  One innovation we present, is the use of higher types to define and reason about cohomology.
  Actually computing cohomology groups, seems to need a principle along the lines of our ``Zariski local choice'' axiom,
  which we justify using a cubical model of homotopy type theory.

  AUGSBURG IDEAS:

  * Spec k[[X]] = D
  * Pushout of two schemes along open subscheme is scheme
  * for V : X \to R-Vect-n \bP(V) is scheme
  * P as space of line (in some vector space)
  * open/closed subsets are D(f) with values in a line bundle
  * define separated schemes, compare with 'inequality is an apartness relation'
  * separated => inequality is apartness  
  * define intersection (of curves) as pullbacks
  * define finite schemes
  * show good intersections are finite schemes?
  * show that dim (R^(intersection)) is the right thing (in examples)
    e.g. for curves in 2-dim. projective space, it should be the product of the degrees
