Here we collect some results of
the theory developed from the axioms
(\axiomref{loc}), (\axiomref{sqc}) and (\axiomref{Z-choice})
that are of a negative nature
and primarily serve the purpose of counterexamples.

We adopt the following definition from
\cite[Section IV.8]{lombardi-quitte}.

\begin{definition}%
  \label{zero-dimensional-ring}
  A ring $A$ is \notion{zero-dimensional}
  if for all $x : A$
  there exists $a : A$ and $k : \N$
  such that $x^k = a x^{k + 1}$.
\end{definition}

\begin{lemma}[using \axiomref{loc}, \axiomref{sqc}, \axiomref{Z-choice}]%
  \label{R-not-zero-dimensional}
  The ring $R$ is not zero-dimensional.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
  Assume that $R$ is zero-dimensional,
  so for every $f : R$ there merely is some $k : \N$ with $f^k \in (f^{k + 1})$.
  We note that $R = \A^1$ is an affine scheme and
  that if $f^k \in (f^{k + 1})$,
  then we also have $f^{k'} \in (f^{k' + 1})$ for every $k' \geq k$.
  This means that we can apply \cref{strengthened-boundedness}
  and merely obtain a number $K : \N$
  such that $f^K \in (f^{K + 1})$ for all $f : R$.
  In particular, $f^{K + 1} = 0$ implies $f^K = 0$,
  so the canonical map
  $\Spec R[X]/(X^K) \to \Spec R[X]/(X^{K + 1})$
  is a bijection.
  But this is a contradiction,
  since the homomorphism $R[X]/(X^{K + 1}) \to R[X]/(X^K)$
  is not an isomorphism.
\end{proof}

\begin{example}[using \axiomref{loc}, \axiomref{sqc}, \axiomref{Z-choice}]%
  \label{non-existence-of-roots}
  It is not the case that
  every monic polynomial $f : R[X]$ with $\deg f \geq 1$ has a root.
  More specifically,
  if $U \subseteq \A^1$ is an open subset
  with the property that
  the polynomial $X^2 - a : R[X]$ merely has a root
  for every $a : U$,
  then $U = \emptyset$.
\end{example}

\begin{proof}
  Let $U \subseteq \A^1$ be as in the statement.
  Since we want to show $U = \emptyset$,
  we can assume a given element $a_0 : U$
  and now have to derive a contradiction.
  By \axiomref{Z-choice},
  there exists in particular a standard open $D(f) \subseteq \A^1$
  with $a_0 \in D(f)$
  and a function $g : D(f) \to R$
  such that ${(g(x))}^2 = x$ for all $x : D(f)$.
  By \axiomref{sqc},
  this corresponds to an element $\frac{p}{f^n} : R[X]_f$
  with ${(\frac{p}{f^n})}^2 = X : R[X]_f$.
  We use \cref{polynomial-with-regular-value-is-regular}
  together with the fact that $f(a_0)$ is invertible
  to get that $f : R[X]$ is regular,
  and therefore $p^2 = f^{2n}X : R[X]$.
  Considering this equation over $R^{\mathrm{red}} = R/\sqrt{(0)}$ instead,
  we can show by induction that all coefficients of $p$ and of $f^n$ are nilpotent,
  which contradicts the invertibility of $f(a_0)$.
\end{proof}

\begin{remark}
  \Cref{non-existence-of-roots} shows that
  the axioms we are using here
  are incompatible with a natural axiom that is true
  for the structure sheaf of the big Ã©tale topos,
  namely that $R$ admits roots for unramifiable monic polynomials.
  The polynomial $X^2 - a$ is even separable for invertible $a$,
  assuming that $2$ is invertible in $R$.
  To get rid of this last assumption,
  we can use the fact that either $2$ or $3$ is invertible in the local ring $R$
  and observe that the proof of \cref{non-existence-of-roots}
  works just the same for $X^3 - a$.
\end{remark}

\begin{proposition}[using ???]%
  \label{RN-non-wqc}
  The $R$-module $R^\N$ is not weakly quasi-coherent.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
  TODO
\end{proof}

\begin{proposition}[using \axiomref{loc}, \axiomref{sqc}, \axiomref{Z-choice}]%
  \label{non-wqc-module-family}
  Not every $R$-module is weakly quasi-coherent
  in the sense of \cref{weakly-quasi-coherent-module}.
  {\color{red} NOTE: Does this add any value compared to \cref{RN-non-wqc}?
  It only uses injectivity of $M_f \to M^{D(f)}$?}
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
  We construct a family of $R$-modules,
  parametrized by the elements of $R$,
  and deduce a contradiction from the assumption that
  all modules of this family are weakly quasi-coherent.

  Given an element $f : R$,
  the $R$-module we want to consider is
  the countable product
  \[ M(f) \colonequiv \prod_{n : \N} R/(f^n) \rlap{.} \]
  If $f \neq 0$ then $M(f) = 0$
  (using \cref{non-zero-invertible}).
  This implies that the $R$-module $M(f)^{f \neq 0}$
  is trivial:
  any function $f \neq 0 \to M(f)$ can only assign the value $0$
  to any of the at most one witnesses of $f \neq 0$.
  If $M(f)$ is weakly quasi-coherent,
  then this means that $M(f)_f$ is also trivial.
  Noting that
  $M(f)$ is not only an $R$-module
  but even an $R$-algebra in a natural way,
  we have
  \begin{align*}
    M(f)_f = 0
    &\;\Leftrightarrow\;
    \exists k : \N.\; \text{$f^k = 0$ in $M(f)$} \\
    &\;\Leftrightarrow\;
    \exists k : \N.\; \forall n : \N.\; f^k \in (f^n) \subseteq R \\
    &\;\Leftrightarrow\;
    \exists k : \N.\; f^k \in (f^{k + 1}) \subseteq R
    \rlap{.}
  \end{align*}

  In summary,
  if the module $M(f)$ is weakly quasi-coherent
  for every $f : R$,
  then the ring $R$ is zero-dimensional
  in the sense of \cref{zero-dimensional-ring}.
  But this is not the case,
  as we saw in \cref{R-not-zero-dimensional}.
\end{proof}
