\maketitle
%We present some work in progress, 
%applying lessons about the Zariski topos from synthetic algebraic geometry \cite{draft} 
%to the topos of light condensed sets \cite{Scholze}. 
%Specifically, we 
%We propose an axiomatization of light condensed sets \cite{Scholze}
%within a univalent homotopy type theory, 
%similar to the axiomatization of Zariski (higher) topos in synthetic algebraic geometry 
%\cite{draft}. 
We propose a variation of the axiomatization of Zariski (higher) topos in synthetic algebraic geometry \cite{draft}
to an axiomatization of (separable) Stone spaces, with Stone duality, within a univalent homotopy type theory.  
The roles of affine schemes and schemes are taken over by Stone spaces and compact Hausdorff spaces respectively. 
In the theory, we can show that any map between compact Hausdorff spaces is continuous, hence the negation of WLPO holds. 
However, we can show that LLPO and Markov's principle do hold. 
We hypothesize that internal results on light condensed sets \cite{Scholze,TODO} can be shown using this theory. 
Furthermore, this work can be seen as refinement of the work in \cite{XuE13}

%\section{Axioms} 
We denote the type of countably presented Boolean algebras by $\Boole$.
Given a Boolean algebra $B$, we define $Sp(B)$, the spectrum of $B$ as the set of Boolean morphisms from $B$ to $2$.  
A type of the form $Sp(B)$ for $B:\Boole$ is called Stone.
%
Two motivating examples of elements of $\Boole$ are as follows:
 \begin{itemize}
   \item $C$ is the free Boolean algebra on countably many generators $(p_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}$. 
     The corresponding set $Sp(C)$ is Cantor space $2^\mathbb N$. 
   \item 
%     The Boolean algebra $B_\infty$ of finite and cofinite subsets of the natural numbers can be presented as 
     The Boolean algebra $ B_\infty$ is %given by 
     the quotient of $C$ by the relations $p_n\wedge p_m = 0$ for $n\neq m$.  
%     A map $B\infty \to 2$ assigns value $1$ to at most one $p_n$. 
     A term of $Sp(B_\infty)$ sends $p_n$ to $1$ for at most one $n$. 
     For this reason, $Sp(B_\infty)$ is denoted $\Noo$. 
%     The element of $\Noo$ sending every $p_n$ to $0$ is denoted $\infty$, 
%     and elements sending $p_n$ to $1$ correspond to $n\in\mathbb N$. 
  \end{itemize} 

\begin{axiom}[Stone duality]
  For any 
  $B:\Boole$, 
  %countably presented Boolean algebra, 
  there is an isomorphism $B \simeq 2^{Sp(B)}$
\end{axiom}
It follows from Stone duality that being Stone is a proposition and $Sp$ defines an embedding from $\Boole$ 
to any universe $\mathcal U$. We denote its image $\Stone$. 
%
%these categories are anti-equivalent. 
%
Any $X:Stone$ has a topology where basic clopens are given by decidable subsets. 
%By Stone duality, for each basic clopen $D$ of $X=Sp(B)$ there is some $b:B$ such that $D$ is
%exactly the set of morphisms sending $b$ to $1$. 
Using Stone duality we can show that any map from a Stone space to $\mathbb N$ is uniformly continuous. 
Both $\Stone$ and $\Boole$ have a natural structure of a category, and 
Stone duality gives that $Sp$ induces a dual equivalence between them. 
%So maps $Sp(B')\to Sp(B)$ correspond to maps $B \to B'$. 

\begin{axiom}[Surjections are Formal Surjections]
  A continuous map $Sp(B')\to Sp(B)$ is surjective iff the corresponding Boolean map $B \to B'$ is injective.
\end{axiom} 
%Note that in the category of Boolean algebras, a map is injective iff it is mono. 
%Hence the above axiom can also be stated as surjections being exactly epimorphisms. 
%Note also that if 1\neq 0, then 2 -> B is injective, hence Sp(B) -> 2 surjective, hence
%Sp(B) inhabited. 
%\begin{axiom}[Inhabited spectra of nontrivial algebras]
%  For any $B:\Boole$ with $1 \neq 0$, $Sp(B)$ is merely inhabited. 
%\end{axiom} 
%\begin{axiom}[Stone truncation]
%  For any $X: \Stone$ we have $\neg \neg X \to  ||X||$.
%\end{axiom} 
Using this axiom, we can show that if $B$ is nontrivial, $Sp(B)$ is merely inhabited.
%
%
Furthermore, note that the sum of the maps
$\Noo \to \Noo$
sending $n$ to $2n,2n+1$ respectively
is surjective but has no section. 
This implies that $\Noo$ is not projective and LLPO holds. 
However, the negation of WLPO follows from Axiom 1.  

\begin{axiom}[Local choice]
  Given $X$ Stone, $E,F$ arbitrary types, a map $E \to F$ and $E\twoheadrightarrow F$ surjective, 
  there is some $Y$ Stone,
    a surjection $Y \twoheadrightarrow X$ and a map $Y\to E$ such that the following diagram commutes:
    \begin{equation*}\begin{tikzcd}
      Y \arrow [d, two heads,dashed] \arrow [r,dashed] & E \arrow[d,""',two heads]\\
      X \arrow[r] & F
    \end{tikzcd}\end{equation*}  
\end{axiom} 

\begin{axiom}[Dependent Choice]
  Given a family of types $E_n$ and $R_n:E_n\rightarrow E_{n+1}\rightarrow {\mathcal U}$ such that
  for all $n$ and $x:E_n$ there exists $y:E_n$ with $p:R~x~y$ then given $x_0:E_0$ there exists
  $u:\Pi_{n:\N}E_n$ and $v:\Pi_{n:\N}R~(u~n)~(u~(n+1))$ and $u~0 = x_0$.
\end{axiom}
%
%We are working on the proof that these axioms can be verified in the interpretation of HoTT in the topos of light condensed sets. We have checked that the results of lectures 2 and 3 of \cite{Scholze} follow from these axioms. 
%In particular, we can prove that $\ints[\Noo]$ is projective in the category of Abelian groups. 
%
We are working on the proof that these axioms can be verified in a model of HoTT, similar
to the model presented in \cite{draft}.
