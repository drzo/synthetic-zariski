\begin{lemma}
Let $A$ be a finitely presented algebra, then the following are equivalent:
\begin{itemize}[(i)]
\item We have $\neg\neg\Spec(A)$.
\item For all f.p. algebras $B$, we have that:
\[(A\otimes B = 0) \to (B=0)\]
\end{itemize}
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
The second condition can be reformulated as:
\[\neg(\Spec(A)\times\Spec(B))\to \neg\Spec(B)\]
so we get (ii) implies (i) by taking $B=R$, and (i) implies (ii) is just negation manipulation.
\end{proof}

This is a first step toward a flat f.p. algebra being faithfully flat if and only if its spectrum is non-empty. It shows one direction.
% Ingo: Why is this not already the full result?
% Hugo: I do not know how to prove (A\otimes M = 0 \to M=0) for any module M from  (A\otimes B = 0 implies B=0) for any f.p. algebra B. Maybe I'm missing something?
