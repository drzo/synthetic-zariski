The first example is very classical, we just give it because it is interesting.

\begin{lemma}
Assume $2=0$. Then the sub-group:
\[\mu_2 = \Spec(R[X]/X^2-1) \subset \A^\times\]
is not smooth.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Since $2=0$, for all $x:R$ we have $x^2=1$ iff $(X^2-1)$. So as a scheme we have:
\[\mu_2 = \Spec(R[X]/(X-1)^2) = \Spec(R[X]/X^2) = \mathbb{D}(1)\]
which is not smooth.
\end{proof}

\begin{proposition}
Not all group schemes are smooth (without any assumption on the characteristic).
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
For any closed proposition $P$ consider the closed subgroup:
\[1+P \subset \Z/2\Z\]
sending $1$ to the the unit $0$ and $P$ to $1$. If the group is smooth then so is $P$, which would then be decidable.
\end{proof}
