Maybe this should be moved to the draft on proper schemes.
This section just repeats classical knowledge which happens to work synthetically.

\begin{definition}
  \begin{enumerate}[(a)]
  \item A \notion{projective scheme} is type $X$ such that there is a closed subset of some $\bP^n$ equivalent to $X$.
  \item A \notion{quasi-projective scheme} is type $X$ such that there is an open subset of a closed subset of some $\bP^n$ equivalent to $X$.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{definition}

We write $[x]$ for the point in $\bP^n$ given by a vector $x:R^{n+1}$.

\begin{definition}
  The \notion{Segre-Embedding} is the map $s:\bP^s\times \bP^t\to \bP^{s\cdot t}$ given by
  \[
    ([x_0:\dots : x_s],[y_0:\dots :y_t])\mapsto [(x_i\cdot y_j)_{i,j}]
  \]
\end{definition}

\begin{proposition}
  The Segre-Embedding is a closed embedding.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
  First, let $[x],[x']:\bP^{s}$ and $[y],[y']:\bP^{t}$ such that there is a $\lambda:R^\times$ with $x_iy_j=\lambda x_i'y_j'$ for all $i,j$.
  There is a $l,ki$ such that $x_l\neq 0$ and $y_k\neq 0$.
  By the condition above, this implies $x_l'\neq 0$ and $y_k'\neq 0$.
  Then we have 
  \[
    x_i = \lambda \cdot \frac{x_i'y_k'}{y_k} = \frac{x_ly_k}{x_l'y_k'} \cdot \frac{x_i'y_k'}{y_k} = \frac{x_l}{x_l'} \cdot x_i'
     \rlap{.}
   \]
   This shows the Segre-Embedding is an embedding.

   A point $[z]:\bP^{s\cdot t}$ is in the image of the Segre-Embedding, if and only if the equation $z_{ij}\cdot z_{kl}=z_{il}\cdot z_{kj}$ holds:
   We have an invertible $z_{ij}$ and can define $x_{l}\colonequiv z_{lj}\cdot z_{ij}^{-1}$ and $y_{k}\colonequiv z_{ik}\cdot z_{ij}^{-1}$.
   Then $x_l\cdot y_k= z_{lj}\cdot z_{ij}^{-1} \cdot z_{ik}\cdot z_{ij}^{-1}=z_{lk}\cdot z_{ij}^{-1}$,
   which shows that $[(z_{lk}\cdot z_{ij}^{-1})_{lk}]$ is in the image of the Segre-Embedding and therefore $[z]$.
 \end{proof}

 \begin{theorem}
   The type of (quasi-)projective schemes is closed under products of schemes.
