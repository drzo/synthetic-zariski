\subsection{General local resolutions}

Among 1-truncated $\partial$-functors, $H^0, H^1$, i.e. the zeroth and first cohomology groups defined in terms of Eilenberg-MacLane spaces, will always be universal.

\subsection{Local resolutions for schemes}

\begin{definition}
  Let $X,Y$ be schemes and.
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item For $M:Y\to\Mod{R}$ and $f:X\to Y$ let $f^*M:\equiv (x:X)\mapsto M_{f(x)}$.
  \item For $M:X\to\Mod{R}$ and $f:X\to Y$ let $f_*M:\equiv (y:Y)\mapsto \prod_{x:\fib_f(y)}M_{\pi_1(x)}$.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{definition}

Both operations preserve weakly quasi coherent modules by \cite{draft}[Theorem 9.1.11].
At the heart of the construction of local resolutions below,
is what is called \notion{Zariski-local choice} in \cite{draft} and justified as an axiom there.
A special case is local-triviality of cohomology classes:

\begin{axiom}
  Let $X=\Spec A$ be an affine scheme and $M:X\to\Mod{R}$.
  For $n>0$ and each $\chi:\prod_{x:X}K(M_x,n)$ there merely is a Zariski cover,
  i.e. coprime
  $f_1,\dots,f_n:A$ such that on each subtype $D(f_i):\equiv (x:X)\mapsto D(f_i(x))$,
  $\chi$ is trivial.
\end{axiom}

With that, there merely are finite covers of schemes trivializing any $M$-cohomology class $\chi$.
Let us denote the coproduct of such a cover with $U_\chi$,
so we have a surjection $u_\chi:U_\chi\to X$ such that $\prod_{x:U_\chi}\chi_x=M_x$.
If we started with a weakly quasi coherent $M$,
we get an injective map of weakly quasi coherent modules:
\[
  M_x \to M_x^{\fib_{u_\chi}(x)}
\]
where the domain is weakly quasi coherent, since it is $({u_\chi}_*u_\chi^*M)_x$.

To get a resolution from that, we need to see that cokernels of monomorphisms
of weakly quasi coherent modules are weakly quasi coherent.
In symbols, for $N\subseteq M$ one of those morphisms, we need:
\[
  (M/N)_f=(M/N)^{D(f)}.
\]
by algebra $(M/N)_f=M_f/N_f$.
This means we are done, if $(M/N)^{D(f)}=M^{D(f)}/{N^{D(f)}}$.
To see this holds, let us consider $0\to N\to M\to M/N\to 0$ as a short exact sequence of dependent modules,
over the subtype of the point $D(f)\subseteq 1=\Spec R$.
Then, taking global sections, we have an exact sequence
\[
 0\to N^{D(f)}\to M^{D(f)}\to (M/N)^{D(f)}\to H^1(D(f),M)
\]
-- but $D(f)=\Spec R_f$ is affine,
so the last term is 0 and $(M/N)^{D(f)}$ is the cokernel $M^{D(f)}/N^{D(f)}$.
So we know that dependent wqc modules over a scheme,
always merely have local resolutions consisting of dependent wqc modules.

By \cref{vanishing-conjecture},
the types $K(M_x,n)^{U_\chi}$, where $M_x$ is wqc and $n>0$ are $0$-connected
-- note that $M_x$ is weakly quasi coherent on $U_\chi$, since it is the push-forwad
of $M_x$ along the map $U_\chi\to 1$.

This means that $\left(K(M_x,n)^{U_\chi}\right)_{n:\N}$ is an Eilenberg-MacLane spectrum.
So we have found resolving sequences for all gerbes on a scheme with coefficients in weakly quasic coherent modules.


\subsection{Local resolutions for \v{C}ech-Cohomology}

Let $X$ be a fixed set and $\{U\}=(U_0,\dots,U_n)$ a fixed cover of $X$.
If $\{U\}$ is acyclic, then the \v{C}ech Cohomology of weakly quasi coherent modules on $X$
will be a universal $\partial$-functor.

The local resolutions can be constructed using the \notion{\v{C}ech-sheaf construction}.
