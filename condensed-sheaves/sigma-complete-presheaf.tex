In this section we should present a model of the following:

\begin{itemize}
\item There is a boolean algebra $B$.
\item The boolean ring $B$ is $\sigma$-complete, i.e. it has countable sup (see below for precise definition).
\item For all $e:B$ we have that the canonical map:
\[B_e \to B^{e=1}\]
is an equivalence.
\item For all $e:B$ we have that $e=1$ has choice.
\item Dependent choice.
\end{itemize}

It is defined as a presheaf topos on a $\sigma$-complete boolean algebra.

\begin{definition}
A boolean algebra is $\sigma$-complete if there exists:
\[\lor : (\N\to B) \to B\]
such that:
\[\forall (\alpha:\N\to B)(n:\N).\ \alpha(n)\leq \lor\alpha\]
\[\forall (e:B)(\alpha:\N\to B).\ \big((\forall(n:\N). \alpha(n)\leq e) \to \lor \alpha \leq e\big)\]
\end{definition}
