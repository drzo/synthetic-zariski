In this section we should present a model of the following:

\begin{itemize}
\item There is a boolean ring $B$.
\item The boolean ring $B$ is $\sigma$-complete, i.e. it has countable sups and infs.
\item For all $e:B$ we have that the canonical map:
\[B_e \to B^{e=1}\]
is an equivalence.
\item For all $e:B$ we have that $e=1$ has choice. (TODO necessary???)
\item Dependent choice.
\end{itemize}

It is the presheaf topos on a $\sigma$-complete boolean algebra.
