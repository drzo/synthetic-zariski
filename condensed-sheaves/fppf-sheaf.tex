\subsection{Fppf sheaves in the Zariski topos}

Now we work inside the Zariski topos (still with boolean algebras).

\begin{definition}
The fppf topology consists of $\Spec(B)$ for all fppf boolean algebra $B$.
\end{definition}

The checking that this is a topology is the same as in algebraic geometry.

\begin{lemma}\label{2-modules-flat}
Any $2$-module is flat.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
This is true for any discrete field, the idea is that any module is a filtered colimit of finitely presented modules, finitely presented modules over a discrete field are free therefore flat, and a filtered colimit of flat modules is flat.
\end{proof}

\begin{remark}
We think that any module over a boolean algebra is flat. We were not able to prove this yet.
\end{remark}

\begin{lemma}
A boolean algebra $B$ is fppf if and only if $0\not=_B1$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
By \cref{2-modules-flat} we have that $B$ is always flat, so we have to prove that:
\[\prod_{M:2-\mathrm{Mod}} B\otimes M = 0 \to M=0\]
if and only if:
\[0\not=_B1\]
The direct is clear, conversly if $0\not=_B1$ then:
\[2\to B\]
is injective, but by \cref{2-modules-flat} we have that any $M$ is flat so that:
\[M\to M\otimes B\]
is injective which is enough to conclude.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
The fppf topology is subcanonical.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
We could just reuse the proof from SAG, but there probably are simpler ones. TODO
\end{proof}

Once again next theorem relies on the unproven \cref{sheaves-internal}.

\begin{theorem}
The Fppf topos satisfy the following:
\begin{itemize}
\item For all c.p. $B$ such that $0\not=_B1$, we have that $\propTrunc{\Spec(B)}$
\item For all c.p. boolean ring $C$, the map:
\[C\to 2^{\Spec(C)}\]
is an equivalence.
\item For all c.p. boolean ring $C$, the type $\Spec(C)$ has representable choice.
\end{itemize}
\end{theorem}

\begin{lemma}
For all c.p. boolean algebras $A,B$, a map:
\[\Spec(B)\to \Spec(A)\]
is surjective if and only if the corresponding map:
\[A\to B\]
is injective.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Assume a surjective map:
\[\Spec(B)\to \Spec(A)\]
corresponding to:
\[f:A\to B\]
Then given $a,b:A$ such that $f(a)=f(b)$ we have that:
\[\prod_{x:\Spec(A)} x(a) = x(b)\]
indeed for any $x:\Spec(A)$ we want to prove a proposition, so we can assume $y:\Spec(B)$ such that $y\circ f = x$ and then $f(a)=f(b)$ allows us to conclude. Therefore $a=b$.

Conversely if the map is injective TODO
\end{proof}
