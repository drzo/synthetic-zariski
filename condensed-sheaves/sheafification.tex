In this section we will give general consideration about sheafification and local choice, essentially we need the following:

\begin{theorem}\label{main-result-sheaves}
If $T$ is a subcanonical toplogy, then the interpretation of the following holds in $T$-sheaves:
\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
\item For any $X\in T$ we have $\propTrunc{X}$.
\item Duality.
\item Any affine scheme has $T$-local choice.
\end{enumerate}
\end{theorem}

And perhaps the same in the Zariski topos (where the topology has to include the Zariski topology):

\begin{theorem}\label{sheaves-internal}
Let $T$ be a subcanonical topology in the Zariski topos, then $T$-sheaves enjoys the following:
\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
\item For any $X\in T$ we have $\propTrunc{X}$.
\item Duality.
\item Any affine scheme has $T$-local choice.
\end{enumerate}
\end{theorem}

I still don't know whether we really should go in two steps.
