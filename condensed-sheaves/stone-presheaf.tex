In this section the goal is to build the presheaf model, which should satisfies the following:

\begin{itemize}
\item There is a boolean ring $\mathbb{B}$.
\item For all c.p. boolean $\mathbb{B}$-algebra $C$, the map:
\[C \to \mathbb{B}^{\Spec(C)}\]
is an equivalence.
\item Affine scheme have choice.
\item Dependent choice.
\end{itemize}
