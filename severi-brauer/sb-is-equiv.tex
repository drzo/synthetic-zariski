\subsection{Generalities on delooping in $T$-sheaves}

\begin{definition}
A type $A$ is $T$-connected if:
\[\forall(x,y:A).\ \propTrunc{x=y}_T\]
\end{definition}

The key intuition for the next lemma is that both $A$ and $B$ are deloopings of the same group in the topos of sheaves.

\begin{lemma}
Assume $A,B$ pointed $T$-connected sheaves. Then any pointed map $f:A\to_\pt B$ inducing an equivalence:
\[\Omega f : \Omega A \simeq \Omega B\]
is itself an equivalence.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
First we prove that is an embedding. So we have to prove that for all $x,y:A$ the map:
\[\mathrm{ap}_f : x=y \to f(x)=f(y)\]
is an equivalence. Since $A$ and $B$ are sheaves so are their identity types, so the map being an equivalence is a modal proposition and we can assume $x$ and $y$ are the basepoint, in which case it is part of the hypothesis.

Now we prove it is surjective, indeed for any $x:B$ we have that $\fib_f(x)$ is a modal propositions so when proving it is inhabited we can assume $x$ is the basepoint of $B$ and give the basepoint of $A$ as a pre-image.
\end{proof}

\subsection{The Severi-Brauer construction is an equivalence}

\begin{lemma}
Assume given $A,B:\AZ_n$ with $\epsilon:A\simeq B$. Then:

sends $I$ to $\epsilon(I)$.
