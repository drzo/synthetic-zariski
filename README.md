# synthetic-zariski
Latex documentation of our understanding of the synthetic /internal theory of the Zariski-Topos.
There are currently three parts:
- Foundations ([pdf](https://felix-cherubini.de/iag.pdf))
- Chech-Cohomology ([early draft pdf](https://felix-cherubini.de/chech.pdf))
- Differential Geometry (so far, [not much](https://felix-cherubini.de/diffgeo.pdf))

There is a related [formalization project](https://github.com/felixwellen/synthetic-geometry).


# Questions

- Is every étale proposition (formally étale and a scheme) an open proposition?
- Is every étale scheme a sub-quotient of a finite set?
- For $f : A$, is $f$ not not zero iff $f$ becomes zero in $A \otimes R/\sqrt{0}$?
  (A corollary of that would be: If the algebra $A$ is not not trivial, then it is trivial.)
