# Synthetic Algebraic Geometry in the Zariski-Topos
Stay updated on synthetic algebraic geometry with the [mailing list](https://lists.chalmers.se/mailman/listinfo/sag).

This is a latex documentation of our understanding of the synthetic /internal theory of the Zariski-Topos.
There are currently the following parts:
- Foundations ([draft pdf](https://felix-cherubini.de/iag.pdf))
- Čech-Cohomology ([early draft pdf](https://felix-cherubini.de/chech.pdf))
- Differential Geometry/étale maps ([early draft pdf](https://felix-cherubini.de/diffgeo.pdf))
- Proper Schemes ([early draft pdf](https://felix-cherubini.de/proper.pdf))
- Topology of Synthetic Schemes ([early draft pdf](https://felix-cherubini.de/topology.pdf))
- $\mathbb A^1$-homotopy theory ([almost empty pdf](https://felix-cherubini.de/A1-homotopy.pdf))
- Random Facts, i.e. a collection of everything that still needs to find a good place ([almost empty pdf](https://felix-cherubini.de/random.pdf))

There is a related [formalization project](https://github.com/felixwellen/synthetic-geometry).


# Questions

- Is every étale proposition (formally étale and a scheme) an open proposition?
- Is every étale scheme a sub-quotient of a finite set?
- For $f : A$, is $f$ not not zero iff $f$ becomes zero in $A \otimes R/\sqrt{0}$?
  (A corollary of that would be: If the algebra $A$ is not not trivial, then it is trivial.)
- If $A$ is an étale $R$-algebra (finitely presented and the spectrum is étale),
  is it impossible to have an injective algebra map $R[X] \to A$?
- Is the proposition "X is affine" not-not-stable, for X a scheme?
  (Then deformations ($D(1) \to \Sch$) of affine schemes would stay affine.)
- Can every bundle (on $Sp A$) of strongly quasicoherent $R$-modules be recovered
  from its $A$-module of global sections?
- Is $\Spec A$ quasi-complete ("compact") for $A$ a finite $R$-algebra (fin gen as $R$-module)?
