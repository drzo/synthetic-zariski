# synthetic-zariski
Latex documentation of our understanding of the synthetic /internal theory of the Zariski-Topos.
There are currently three parts:
- Foundations ([pdf](https://felix-cherubini.de/iag.pdf))
- Chech-Cohomology
- Differential Geometry (so far, not much)

There is a related [formatization project](https://github.com/felixwellen/synthetic-geometry).


# Questions

- Is the product of irreducible types/schemes irreducible?
- Is Pi over an open proposition on projective space open?
