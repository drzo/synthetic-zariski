\subsection{The Tangent Space}

We will use the concept of tangent spaces from synthetic differential geometry.
More conretely, we follow \cite{david-orbifolds}[Section 4]
on the subject, which also uses homotopy type theory as a basis.

\begin{definition}
  The \notion{first order disk}\index{$\D(n)$} of dimension $n$ is the type
  \[ \D(n)\colonequiv \{x:R^n\vert x^Tx=0\}\rlap{.}\]
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
  Let $X$ be a type and $p:X$ a point in $X$.
  The \notion{tangent space}\index{$T_pX$} of $X$ at $p$, is the type
  \[ T_pX\colonequiv \{d:\D(1)\to X\vert d(0)=p \}\rlap{.}\]
\end{definition}
